  <h3 id="_what_s_an_enterprise_web_application">What&#8217;s an Enterprise Web Application?</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This book has the word Enterprise in its title, which needs to be explained, and we&#8217;ll do it by examples. Creating a Web application that will process orders is not the same as creating a Web site to publish
blogs. Enterprise applications include company-specific workflows, and usually they need to be integrated with number of internal systems, data sources and processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Google Doc is not an enterprise Web application. But Google appliance integrating search operating on company documents, databases, processes, tickets, and providing collaboration is - it integrates
consumer-workforce front office with what the company does (back office).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Google Maps is not an enterprise application. But Google Maps integrated with the company site used by insurance agents to plan daily route, scheduling, doing address verification and geo-coding is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Just using a Web application in some business doesn&#8217;t make it an enterprise Web application. If you take Gmail as is, it won&#8217;t be an enterprise application until you integrate it into another process of your business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Is an online game an enterprise application? It depends on the game. A multi-player online roulette game hooked up to a payment system, and maintaining users' accounts is an enterprise Web application. But
playing Sudoku online doesn&#8217;t feel too enterprisey.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>How about a dating Web site? If the site just offers an ability to display singles - it&#8217;s just a publishing site as there is not much of a business there. Can you turn a dating Web site into an enterprise
application? It&#8217;s possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Some people will argue that an enterprise application must supports multiple users, high data load, be scalable, have business and persistence layers, offer professional support et al. We don&#8217;t believe
that a Web application should do all this to qualify for the adjective <em>enterprise</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s create a simple definition of an enterprise Web application:</p>

  <p>In this book we are going to build a Save the Child Web application that will allow people to register, donate, find local kids that need help, match donors and recipients, upload images, videos and display
statistics. Would these feature make Save the Child an enterprise Web application? Yes, our non-for-profit organization that collects donations for ill kids is our enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>During the last decade the authors of this book worked on many enterprise Web applications using variety of programming languages and frameworks: HTML, JavaScript, Java, and Flex to name a few. Apache Flex
and Java produce compiled code that runs in a well known and predictable virtual machine (JVM and Flash Player respectively).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This book is about developing software using what&#8217;s known as HTML5 stack. But only the first chapter of this book will offer you an overview of the selected HTML5 tags and APIs. The second chapter is an
advanced introduction to JavaScript. The rest of the chapters are about designing, re-designing, developing, and re-developing a sample Web site Save Sick Child. You&#8217;ll be learning whatever is required for building this Web application on the go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You&#8217;ll be using dynamic HTML (DHTML), which is HTML5, JavaScript, and Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS). We&#8217;ll add to the mix the XMLHttpRequest object that lives in a Web browser and communicates with the server without the need to refresh the entire Web page (a.k.a. AJAX). JSON will be our data format
of choice for data exchange between the Web browser and the server.</p>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_from_dhtml_to_html5">From DHTML to HTML5</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>DHTML has been introduced in Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 5, and several years later it was substituted with a more popular acronym AJAX. Back in 1999 Microsoft introduced <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> object to allow the Web version of their mail client Outlook to update the browser&#8217;s window without the need to refresh the entire Web page. The market share of IE5 was about 90% at the time, and in enterprises it was literally the only approved browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Many years passed by and today&#8217;s Internet ecosystems changed quite a bit. Web browsers are a lot smarter and performance of JavaScript improved substantially. The browsers support 6-8-12 simultaneous connections per domain (as opposed to 2 five years ago), which gave a performance boost to all AJAX applications. At least one third of all Web requests is being made from smart phones or tablets. Apple Inc. started their war against browser&#8217;s plugins hence using embedded Java VM or Flash Player is not an option there. The growing need to support a huge variety of mobile devices gave another boost for HTML5 stack, which is supported by all devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But choosing HTML5 as the least common denominator that works in various devices and browsers means lowering requirements for your enterprise project. From the very beginning parameters like reliability, ability to adapt to different the screen sizes and densities will be simplified comparing to developing for one specific VM, device or OS. Instead of implementing these features, the functional specification will include testing under several Web browsers, in many different screen sizes and
resolutions. HTML5 developers spend a lot more time in the debugger that people who develop for a known VM.
Get ready to solving problems like a dropdown does not show any data in one browser while working fine in all others. Can you imagine a situation when the click event is not always generated while working in Java, Flex, or Silverlight? Get ready for such surprises while testing your DHTML application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You&#8217;ll save some time because there is no need to compile JavaScript, but you&#8217;ll spend more time testing deployed code. The final deliverable of an HTML5 project may have as low as half of the functionality
comparing to the same project developed for a VM. But you&#8217;ll gain a little better Web adaptability, easier implementation of full text search and mashups. The integration with other technologies will also
become easier with HTML/JavaScript. If all these advantages are important to your application choose HTML5.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JavaScript will enforce its limitations on any serious and complex enterprise project. You can develop a number of fairly independent windows, but creating a well tested and reliable HTML5 takes time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this book we&#8217;ll be using some JavaScript frameworks - the are dozens of those on the market. Several of them promise to cover all the needs of your Web application. Overall, there are two main categories of
frameworks:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
  
  <blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>a) Those that allow you to take an existing DHTML Web site and easily add new attributes to all or some page elements so they would start shining, blinking, or do some other fun stuff. Such frameworks don&#8217;t promote component-based development. They may not include navigation components, grids, trees, which are pretty typical for any UI of the corporate tasks. JQuery is probably the best representative of this group- it&#8217;s light (30Kb), extendable, and easy to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>b) Another group of frameworks offers rich libraries of high-level components and allow you to extend them.But overall, such components are supposed to be used together becoming a platform for your Web UI. These components process some events, offer support of the Model-View-Controller paradigm, have a proprietary way of laying out elements on the Web page, organize navigation et al. Ext JS from Sencha belongs to this group.</p>
</div>

  </blockquote>
  <div class="attribution">
    
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We&#8217;ll use both JQuery and Ext JS and will show you how to develop Web applications with each of these popular frameworks. JQuery is good for improving an existing JavaScript site. JQuery can be used to program
about 80% of a Web site. You should use it for the look and feel support, which is what it&#8217;s meant for. But you can&#8217;t use it for building your application component model. The component model of Ext JS is
applicable in about 20% of a Web site, which includes an application piece rather than just being a set of Web pages. Typically it&#8217;s a serious view navigator or a wizard to implement a serious business
process or a workflow that includes a client&#8217;s part.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
  
  <blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JavaScript frameworks are hiding from software developers all incompatibilities and take care of the cases when a Web browser doesn&#8217;t support some HTML5, CSS3, or JavaScript features yet.</p>
</div>

  </blockquote>
  <div class="attribution">
    
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>High-level UI components and a workflow support are needed for a typical enterprise application where the user needs to perform several steps to complete the business process. And these 20% of an application&#8217;s code will require 80% of the project time of complex development. So choosing a framework is not the most difficult task. The main problem with DHTML projects is not how to pick the best JavaScript framework for
development, but finding the right software developers. Lack of qualified developers increases the importance of using specialized frameworks for code testing. The entire code base must be thoroughly
tested over and over again. We&#8217;ll discuss this subject in the Chapter 5 dedicated to test-driven development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A JavaScript developer has to remember all unfinished pieces of code. Many things that we take for granted with compiled languages simply don&#8217;t exist in JavaScript. For example, in Java or C# just by looking at
the method signature you know what are the data types of the method&#8217;s parameters. In JavaScript you can only guess if the parameter names are self descriptive. Take the Google&#8217;s framework GWT that allows developers write code in Java with auto-generation of the JavaScript code. Writing code in one language with further conversion and deployment in another one is a controversial idea unless the source and generated languages are very similar. We&#8217;re not big fans of GWT, because after writing the code you&#8217;ll need
to be able to debug it. This is when a Java developer meets a foreign language JavaScript.The ideology and psychology of programming in JavaScript and Java are different. A person who writes in Java/GWT has
to know how to read and interpret deployed JavaScript code. On the other hand, using TypeScript or CoffeeScript to produce JavaScript code can be a time saver.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Ext JS framework creators decided to extend JavaScript introducing their version of classes and more familiar syntax for object-oriented languages. Technically they are extending or replacing the constructs of the JavaScript itself extending the alphabet. Ext JS recommends creating objects using <tt>ext.create</tt> instead of the operator <tt>new</tt>. But Ext JS is still a JavaScript framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JQuery framework substantially simplifies working with browser&#8217;s DOM elements and there are millions of small components that know how to do one thing well, for example, an image slider. But it&#8217;s still JavaScript and requires developers to understand the power of JavaScript functions, callbacks, and closures.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_should_we_develop_in_html5_if_its_standard_is_not_finalized_yet">Should we develop in HTML5 if its standard is not finalized yet?</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The short answer is yes. If you are planning to develop mainly for the mobile market, it&#8217;s well equipped with the latest Web browsers and if you&#8217;ll run into issues there. they won&#8217;t be caused by the lack of HTML5
support. In the market of the enterprise Web applications, the aging Internet Explorer 8 is still being widely used and they don&#8217;t support some of the HTML5 specific features. But it&#8217;s not a show stopper either.If you are using one of the JavaScript frameworks that offers cross-browser compatibility, most likely, they take care of IE8 issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The more conservative approach to achieving the browser compatibility is not by relying on the framework promises, but by testing and adjusting your application in different browsers. The chances are that you may
need to be fixing the framework&#8217;s code here and there. Maintaining compatibility is a huge challenge for any framework&#8217;s vendor, which in some cases can consist of just one developer. You shouldn&#8217;t have hard
feelings against the developers behind the framework of your choice. These guys simply don&#8217;t have time to fix everything. You need to form an attitude that a JavaScript framework is similar to a good Legos set that will require your creativity too. Don&#8217;t get angry. Cure the framework. Spend some time working on the framework, and then work on your application code. Ideally, submit your fixes back to the framework&#8217;s
code base - most of them are open source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you are planning to write pure JavaScript, add a tiny framework Modernizr to your code base, which will detect if a certain feature is supported by the user&#8217;s Web browser, and if not - provide an alternative solution. We like the analogy with TV sets. People with latest 3D HD TV sets and those who have 50-year old black and white televisions can watch the same movie even though the quality of the picture will be drastically different.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you are starting working on your first HTML5 enterprise project, get ready to solve the same tasks as Java, JavaFX, Silverlight, or Flexdevelopers face:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Reliability of the network communications. What if the data never arrive from/to the server? Is it possible to recover the lost data? Where they got lost? Can we re-send the lost data? What to do with
duplicates?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Modularization of your application. If your application has certain rarely used menus don&#8217;t even load the code that handles this menu.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Perceived performance. How quickly the main window of your application is loaded to the user&#8217;s computer? How heavy is the framework&#8217;s code base?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Should you store the application state on the server or on the client?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Does the framework offer a rich library of components?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Does the framework support creation of loosely coupled application components? Is the event model well designed?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Does the framework of your choice cover most of the needs of your application, or you&#8217;ll need to use several frameworks?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Is well written documentation available?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Does the framework of your choice locks you in? Does it restrict your choices? Can you easily replace this framework with another one if need be?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Is there an active community to ask for help with technical questions?</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We could continue adding items to this list. But our main message is that developing HTML5 applications is not just about adding tag video and canvas to a Web page. It&#8217;s about serious JavaScript programming.</p>

  <h3 id="_javascript_a_brief_history">JavaScript: A Brief History</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The JavaScript programming language was designed in 1995 by Brendan Eich, who was working for Netscape Communications Corporation at the time. His goal was to allow developers create more interactive Web pages. Initially the name of this language was Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally Netscape agreed with Sun Microsystems, creator of Java to rename it to JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A year later, the language was given to an international standards body called ECMA, which formalized the language into <em>ECMAScript standard</em> so that other Web browser vendors could create their implementation of this standard. JavaScript is not the only language created based on the ECMAScript specification - ActionScript is a good example of another popular dialect of ECMAScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To learn more about the history of JavaScript from the source watch the Brendan Eich’s presentation
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj49rmc01Hs">"JavaScript at 17"</a> at O’Reilly’s conference Fluent 2012.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Vast majority of today&#8217;s JavaScript code is being executed by the Web browsers, butthere are JavaScript engines that can execute JavaScript code independently. For example, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">Google’s V8</a> JavaScript engine implements ECMAScript 5 and is used not only in the Chrome browser, but can run in a standalone mode and can be embedded in any C++ application. Using the same programming language on the client and the server is the main selling point of node.js, which runs in V8. Oracle’s Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 will include the JavaScript engine Nashorn that not only can run on both the server and the client computers, but also allows to embed the fragments of JavaScript into Java programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the 90th, JavaScript was considered a second class language used mainly for prettifying Web pages. In 2005 the techniques known as AJAX (see Chapter 4) made a significant impact to the way Web pages were built. With AJAX, the specific content inside the Web page could be updated without the need to make a full page refresh. For example, Google&#8217;s gmail that inserts just one line at the top of your input box whenever the new email arrives - it doesn&#8217;t re-retrieve the entire content of your Inbox from the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>AJAX gave a second birth to JavaScript. But the vendors of Web browsers were not eager to implement the latest specifications of ECMAScript. Browsers’ incompatibility and lack of good development tools  prevented JavaScript from becoming the language of choice for Web applications. Let’s not forget about the ubiquitous Flash Player – an excellent VM supported by all desktop Web browsers. Rich Internet Applications written in ActionScript were compiled into the byte code and executed by Flash Player on the user’s machine inside the Web browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If AJAX saved JavaScript, then rapid proliferation of tablets and smartphones made it really hot. Today&#8217;s mobile devices come equipped with modern Web browsers, and in the mobile world there is no need to make sure that your Web application will work in the 4-year old Internet Explorer 8. Adobe&#8217;s decision to stop supporting Flash Player in the mobile Web browsers is yet another reason to turn to JavaScript if your Web application has to be accessed from smartphones or tablets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>ECMASript, 5th Edition has been published in 2009 and is currently supported by all modern Web browsers. If you are interested in discovering if specific features of ECMAScript 5 are supported by a particular Web browser, check the latest version of the <a href="http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/#">ECMAScript 5
compatibility table</a>. At the time of this writing the snapshot of the Chrome Browser v. 22 looks as in <a href="#FIG2-1">ECMAScript 5 Compatibility Sample Chart</a> below:</p>

  <p>JavaScript became the lowest common denominator available on thousands of different devices. Yes, the JavaScript engines are not exactly the same on thousands devices that people use to login to Facebook,
but they are pretty close, and using some of the JavaScript frameworks spare you from worrying about their incompatibilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language that arrives to the Web browser as text. The JavaScript engine optimizes and compiles the code before the execution. If the JavaScript engine is a part of a Web page, the browser will load and execute the JavaScript code embedded or referenced between the HTML tags <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/script&gt;</tt>. JavaScript was originally created for Web browsers, which were supposed to display whatever content has successfully arrived. What if an image has not arrived from the server? You’ll see a broken image icon. What if erroneous JavaScript code with syntax errors has arrived to the browser? Well, the engine will try to execute whatever has arrived. The end users may appreciate such browser&#8217;s forgiveness when at least some content is available, but the software developers should be ready to spend more time debugging (in multiple browsers) the errors that could have been caught by compilers in other programming languages.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_why_declaring_javascript_variables">Why Declaring JavaScript Variables</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JavaScript is a weakly typed language hence the developers don’t have a luxury of strong compiler&#8217;s help that Java or C# developers enjoy. This is easily explainable. Imagine that if in Java or C# instead of declaring variables of specific data types everything would be of type <tt>Object</tt>, and you could assign to it any value – a string, a number, or a custom object <tt>Person</tt>. This would substantially complicate the ability of the compiler to weed out all possible errors. You don’t need to declare variables in JavaScript – just assign a value and the JavaScript engine will figure out the proper type during the execution of your code.For example, the variable named <tt>girlfriend</tt> will have a data type of <tt>String</tt>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">

  <p>Since I haven’t used the keyword <tt>var</tt> in front of <tt>girlfriend</tt>, this variable will have the global scope. Variables declared with <tt>var</tt> inside functions are local. Consider the following function declaration:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">function addPersonalInfo(){
   var address ="123 Main Street";      // local String variable
   age=25;                              // global Number variable
   var isMarried = true;                // local boolean variable
       isMarried = "don't remember";    // now it's of String type
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The variables <tt>address</tt> and <tt>isMarried</tt> are visible only inside the function <tt>addPersonalInfo()</tt>. The variable <tt>age</tt> becomes global because of omission of the keyword <tt>var</tt>. In Chapter 3, you&#8217;ll see an example of how to limit the scope of the variables to avoid polluting the global name space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The variable <tt>isMarried</tt> changes its type from <tt>Boolean</tt> to <tt>String</tt> during the execution of the above script, and JavaScript engine won&#8217;t complain assuming that the programmer knows what she’s doing. So be ready for the run-time surprises and allocate a lot more time for testing than with programs written in  compiled languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Yet another moving part is the JavaScript engine where your code will run. Unless you are developing for strictly controlled enterprise environment you can&#8217;t assume that the end-user will have the same runtime as yours. You must test your code in multiple Web browsers.</p>

  <h3 id="_which_ide_to_use">Which IDE to Use</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Selecting an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports JavaScript is a matter of your personal preference. Since there is no compilation stage and most of your debugging will be done using the Web browser tools, picking a text editor that supports syntax highlighting is all that most developers need. For example, there is an excellent commercial text editor <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 2</a>. Among many programming languages this editor understands the keywords of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it offers not only syntax highlighting, context sensitive help, and auto-complete too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you are coming from the Java background, the chances are that you are familiar with free and open sourced Eclipse IDE. In this case install the Eclipse plugin <a href="http://eclipse.org/vjet/">VJET</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Oracle&#8217;s IDE <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/HTML5">NetBeans 7.3</a> and above support HTML5 and JavaScript development and includes JavaScript debugger that allows your code to connect to the Web browser, while debugging inside the IDE. If you prefer Microsoft technologies, they offer excellent JavaScript support in Visual Studio 2012.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this book we&#8217;ll use an Eclipse-based <a href="http://aptana.com">Aptana Studio 3 IDE</a>. Aptana Studio is available free of charge.  Aptana Studio comes with embedded Web Server so you can test your JavaScript code without the need to start any additional software. In this chapter we’ll use Aptana Studio IDE to
illustrate the features of JavaScript, and in the next chapter you&#8217;ll be working with a number of Aptana projects that will lead you through the development of the first version of our Save Sick Child Web application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For the real world development we recommend using commercial <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm">IDE WebStorm</a> from JetBrains. In addition to smart context sensitive help, auto-complete, and syntax
highlighting it offers HTML5 templates, and the code coverage feature that identifies the code fragment that haven&#8217;t been tested. All of the editors and IDEs listed here are either available for free or are priced in the area of $60 USD. Try them all and pick the one that best fits your coding habits.</p>

  <p>Download and install Aptana Studio 3 from <a href="http://aptana.com">http://aptana.com</a>. Start Aptana and close the start page it displays by clicking on the little X on the tab. Then customize the color theme of this IDE by clicking the rainbow-colored circle on its toolbar. We usually select the theme called Eclipse. After the first start of Aptana you’ll see the message on the left side that reads &#8220;There are no projects in your workspace. To get started, please create or import an existing one.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you want to start playing with the code samples that come with this book, click on the button Import Project, select the General | Archive file. Find the zip file you&#8217;d like to use, e.g. chapter2.zip, and press Finish. The project from the selected zip file will be imported into the Aptana&#8217;s <em>workspace</em>, which is nothing more than a folder on the disk where the source code will reside. When you work in Aptana IDE you see a set of <em>views</em> (panels). This set is called <em>perspective</em>. For Web projects Aptana uses Web perspective, which is indicated at the top right corner. Pressing the icon with a little pus sign at the top right allows to open another perspective with its own set of views.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s get started with creating a project from scratch by pressing the button Create Project on the left. You could have also created a new Web Project using the File menu. On the next window you&#8217;ll need to select a wizard, and we&#8217;ll be always working with Web Projects throughout this book. The next window will offer you to select a project template - let&#8217;s stick to the simplest one - Default Project. Name it  MyFirstProject.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To add an HTML file to this project select the menu File | New From Template | HTML | HTML5 Template. Aptana will offer you new_file.html the name of this file - no need to change it for now.

Aptana starts its built-in Web server that by default runs on the port 8020 (it&#8217;s configurable in Aptana Preferences). The Web browser opens up and displays the page that looks like the one in <a href="#FIG2-3">Running MyFirstProject</a>. Aptana has used its default template to generate HTML file.

  <h3 id="_adding_javascript_to_html">Adding JavaScript to HTML</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If your JavaScript is a part of HTML document, typically, you&#8217;ll be adding your <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> tags at the end of HTML file. The reason is simple - your JavaScript code may be manipulating with HTML elements, and you want them to exist by the time the script runs. The other way to ensure that the code is not running unless the Web page has loaded is by catching window&#8217;s <tt>load</tt> event, and you&#8217;ll see such example later in this chapter in the section on browser&#8217;s events. Some JavaScript frameworks may have their own approach to dealing with HTML content and in Chapter 7 you&#8217;ll see that the main HTML file of the Web application written with Ext JS framework has <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> tags followed by the empty <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> tags. But let&#8217;s keep things simple for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Add the following fragment at the very end (right above the closing <tt>&lt;/body&gt;</tt> tag) of the new_file.html from <a href="#FIG2-2">Aptana IDE with one HTML5 file</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Note that the <tt>Alert</tt> popup box is shown on top of the Web page that already rendered all of its HTML components. Now move the above code up to the end of the <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> section and re-run new_file.html. The picture is different now - the Alert box is shown before the HTML rendering is complete.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this simple example this doesn&#8217;t cause any malfunctioning of the code, but if our JavaScript would need to manipulate with HTML elements, we&#8217;d run into issues of accessing non-existent components. Beside simple <tt>Alert</tt> box, JavaScript has <tt>Confirm</tt> and <tt>Prompt</tt> boxes, which allow asking OK/Cancel type of questions or request some input from the user.</p>

        In a real life you won&#8217;t be deploying your projects under Aptana&#8217;s internal Web server.

  <p>The best way to learn any program is to run it step by step through a debugger. While some people appreciate using debuggers offered by Aptana, NetBeans, or Visual Studio, we prefer to debug using great tools offered by the major Web browsers:</p>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_javascript_functions_gentle_introduction">JavaScript Functions. Gentle Introduction</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now comes the chicken or the egg dilemma. What should be explained first - functions or objects? Understanding of objects is needed for some of the function code samples and visa versa. We&#8217;ll start with simple function use cases, but will be switching to objects as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Many of the readers can have experience with object-oriented languages like Java or C#, where classes can include <em>methods</em> implementing required functionality. Then these methods can be invoked with or without instantiation of the objects. If a JavaScript object includes functions they are called <em>methods</em>. But JavaScript functions don&#8217;t have to belong to an object. You can just declare a function and invoke it. Just like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">//Function declaration
function calcTax (income, dependents){
   var tax;
   // Do stuff here
   return tax;
}

//Function invocation
calcTax(50000, 2);
var myTax = calcTax(50000,2);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Please note that the data types of the function parameters <tt>income</tt> and <tt>dependents</tt> are not specified. We can only guess that they are numbers based on their names. If a software developer won&#8217;t bother giving meaningful names to function parameters, the code becomes difficult to read. After the function <tt>calcTax()</tt> is invoked and complete, the variable <tt>myTax</tt> will have the value returned by the function.
In the above code sample the JavaScript engine will not evaluate the function <tt>calcTax()</tt> until it&#8217;s actually invoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Another important thing to notice is that our function has a name <tt>calcTax</tt>. But this is not always the case - JavaScript allows functions to be <em>anonymous</em>. If you see the line of code where the keyword <tt>function</tt> is preceded by any other character this is not a function declaration, but a function expression. Consider the following variation of the tax calculation sample:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">//Function expression
var doTax=function (income, dependents){
	//do stuff here
   return tax;
}

//Function invocation
var myTax=doTax(50000,2);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the code above the <tt>function</tt> keyword is being used in the expression - we assign the anonymous function to the variable <tt>doTax</tt>. After this assignment just the text of the function is assigned to the variable <tt>doTax</tt> - the anonymous function is not being invoked just yet. It&#8217;s important to understand that even though the code of this anonymous function ends with <tt>return tax;</tt> actually, the tax calculation and return of its value is not happening until the <tt>doTax()</tt> is invoked. Only then the function is evaluated and the variable <tt>myTax</tt> will get whatever value this function returns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Yet another example of a function expression is when it&#8217;s placed inside the <em>grouping operator</em> - parentheses as shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">(function calcTax (income, dependents){
   // Do stuff here
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Another interesting concept of JavaScript is self-executing functions. Adding an extra pair of parentheses will cause the function expression located in the first set of parentheses to be executed right away.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">(function calcTax (income, dependents){
   // Do stuff here
})();</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The first set of parentheses hides its internal code from the outside world creating a scope or a closed ecosystem, where the function&#8217;s code will operate. Try to add a line invoking this function after the last line in the above code sample, e.g. <tt>calcTax(50000,2)</tt>, and you&#8217;ll get an error - "calcTax is not defined". There is a way to expose some of the internal content of such a <em>closure</em> and you&#8217;ll see how to do it later in this chapter.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_javascript_objects_gentle_introduction">JavaScript Objects. Gentle Introduction</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JavaScript objects are simply unordered collections of properties. You can assign new or delete existing properties from the objects during the runtime whenever you please. In classical object oriented languages there are <em>classes</em> and there are <em>objects</em>. For example, based on one Java a class you can create  multiple instances of its objects.</p>

  <p>Objects can contain other objects. If a property of an object literal is also an object, you just need to specify the value of this property in an extra pair of curly braces. For example, you can represent the telephone of a person as an object having two properties: the type and the number. The following code snippet adds a nested object to store a work phone as a <em>nested object</em> inside the person&#8217;s object. Run this code in the FireBug&#8217;s console and it&#8217;ll print "Call Julia at work 212-555-1212".</p>

        Since we already started using arrays, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that arrays can store any objects. You don&#8217;t have to declare the size of the array upfront and can create new arrays as easy as <tt>var myArray=[]</tt> or <tt>var myArray=new Array()</tt>. You can even store function declarations as regular strings, but they will be evaluated on the array initialization. For example, during the <tt>greetArray</tt> initialization the user will see a prompt asking to enter her name, and, when it&#8217;s done, the <tt>greetArray</tt> will store two strings.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JavaScript functions are more then just some named pieces of code that implements certain behavior. They also can become objects themselves by a magic of the <tt>new</tt> operator. To make things even more intriguing, the function calls can have memories, which will be explained in the section about closures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If a function is meant to be instantiated with the <tt>new</tt> operator it&#8217;s called a <em>constructor function</em>. If you are familiar with Java or C# you understand the concept of a class constructor that is being executed only once during the instantiation of a class. Now imagine that there is only a constructor without any class declaration that still can be instantiated with the <tt>new</tt> operator as in the following example.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you take a closer look at the screenshot from <a href="#FIG2-13">The instance-specific <tt>__proto__</tt> variable</a> you&#8217;ll see that the <tt>Person</tt> and <tt>Employee</tt> objects have redundant properties <tt>name</tt> and <tt>title</tt>. We&#8217;ll deal with this redundancy in the section titled "Call and Apply". But first let&#8217;s introduce and cure the redundancy in method declarations when the prototypal inheritance is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s add a method to <tt>addSubordinate()</tt> to the ancestor object <tt>Person</tt> that will populate its array <tt>subordinates</tt>. Who knows, maybe an object <tt>Contractor</tt> (descendant of a <tt>Person</tt>) will need to be added in the future, so the ancestor&#8217;s method <tt>addSubordinate()</tt> can be reused. First, we&#8217;ll do it  the wrong way to illustrate the redundancy problem, and then we&#8217;ll do it right. Consider the following code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">// Constructor function Person
function Person(name, title){
	this.name=name;
	this.title=title;
	this.subordinates=[];

    // Declaring method inside the constructor function
	this.addSubordinate=function (person){
		this.subordinates.push(person)
	}


}

// Constructor function Employee
function Employee(name, title){
	this.name=name;
	this.title=title;
}

// Changing the inheritance of Employee
Employee.prototype = new Person();

var mgr =  new Person("Alex", "Director");
var emp1 = new Employee("Mary", "Specialist");
var emp2 = new Employee("Joe", "VP");

mgr.addSubordinate(emp1);
mgr.addSubordinate(emp2);
console.log("mgr.subordinates.length is " + mgr.subordinates.length);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The method <tt>addSubordinate()</tt> here is declared inside the constructor function <tt>Person</tt>, which becomes an ancestor of the <tt>Employee</tt>. After instantiation of two <tt>Employee</tt> objects the method <tt>addSubordinate()</tt> is duplicated for each instance.</p>

  <p>Let&#8217;s use Google Chrome Developer Tools profiler to see the sizes of the objects allocated on the Heap memory. But first we&#8217;ll set up two breakpoints - one before, and one after creating our instances as shown on <a href="#FIG2-14">Preparing Breakpoints Take 1.</a>.</p>

  <p>When the execution of the code will stop at the first breakpoint, we&#8217;ll switch to the Profiler tab and take the first Heap snapshot.

The dropdown at the status bar allows to view the objects allocated between the snapshots 1 and 2. <a href="#FIG2-15">Objects allocated between snapshots 1 and 2</a> depicts this view of the profiler.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now we&#8217;ll change the code to declare the method not inside the <tt>Person</tt> constructor function, but on it&#8217;s prototype - and this is the right way to declare methods in functions to avoid code duplication.</p>

  <p>So if you need to declare a method on the object that will play a role of the ancestor, do it on the prototype level. The only exception to this rule is the case when such method needs to use some object specific variable that&#8217;s different for each instance - in case declare methods inside the constructors (see the section on closures for details).</p>

  <h4 id="_method_overriding">Method overriding</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Since JavaScript allows declaring methods on an object as well as on its prototype, overriding a method becomes really simple. The following code sample declares the method <tt>addSubordinate()</tt> on the prototype of the <tt>Person</tt> object, but then the object <tt>p1</tt> overrides this method.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">function Person(name, title){

  this.name=name;
  this.title=title;
  this.subordinates=[];
}

Person.prototype.addSubordinate=function(person){

   this.subordinates.push(person);
   console.log("I'm in addSubordinate on prototype " + this);
}

var p1=new Person("Joe", "President");

    p1.addSubordinate=function(person){

    this.subordinates.push(person);
    console.log("I'm in addSubordinate in object " + this);
  }

var p2 = new Person("Mary", "Manager")

    p1.addSubordinate(p2);
</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Running the above code prints only one line: "I&#8217;m in addSubordinate in object [object Object]". This proves that the method <tt>addSubordinate()</tt> on the prototype level is overridden. We can also improve this example a little bit and override the method <tt>toString()</tt> on the <tt>Person</tt>. Just add the following fragment to the prior to instantiating <tt>p1</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now the code prints "I&#8217;m in addSubordinate in object name:Joe, title:President". Overriding the method <tt>toString()</tt> on objects is a common practice as it gives a textual representation of your objects.</p>

  <p>You are about to read one of the most confusing sections in this book. The confusion is caused by some inconsistencies in JavaScript design and implementations by various browsers.

You&#8217;ll get an error - the variable <tt>title</tt> is not defined. Without the keyword <tt>this</tt> the JavaScript engine tries to find the variable <tt>title</tt> in the global namespace. Declaring and initializing the variable <tt>title</tt> outside of the <tt>Person</tt> declaration get rid of this error, but this is not what we want to do.

Notice two variables with the same name <tt>taxDeduction</tt> - one of them has global scope and another belongs to <tt>myTaxObject</tt>.

  <p>This code fragment illustrates the use of <em>nested functions</em>. The object method <tt>doTaxes()</tt> has a nested function <tt>mafiaSpecial()</tt>, which is not visible from outside of the <tt>myTaxObject</tt>, but it can be certainly invoked inside <tt>doTaxes()</tt>. What number do you think this code will print after the words "Will deduct "? Will it print three, four, or five hundred? Run this code in Firebug, Chrome Developer Tools or any other way and you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;ll print 300!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But this doesn&#8217;t sound right, does it? The problem is that in JavaScript the context where the function executes depends on the way it was invoked. In this case the function <tt>mafiaSpecial()</tt> was invoked as a function (not a method) without specifying the object it should apply to, and JavaScript makes it operate in the global object, hence the global variable <tt>taxDeduction</tt> having the value of 300 is being used. So in expression <tt>this.taxDeduction</tt>  the variable <tt>this</tt> means global unless the code is operated in the strict mode.</p>

  <h4 id="_callbacks">Callbacks</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Can you live without using <tt>call()</tt> and <tt>apply()</tt>?  Sure you can, but in JavaScript can easily create <em>callbacks</em> - you can pass the code of one function as a parameter to another function for execution in the latter function&#8217;s context. Most likely you&#8217;ve seen how event handlers are declared. If a user clicks on this button here&#8217;s the name of the handler function to call:
<tt>myButton.addEventListener("click", myFunctionHandler)</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>It&#8217;s important to understand that you don&#8217;t not immediately call the function <tt>myFunctionHandler</tt> here - you are just registering it. If and only if the user will click on <tt>myButton</tt> then the callback <tt>myFunctionHandler</tt> has to be invoked in the context of the <tt>myButton</tt> object. The functions <tt>call()</tt> and <tt>apply()</tt> exist exactly for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s consider an example when you need to write a function that will take two arguments - and array with preliminary tax data and a callback function to be applied to each element of this array. The following code sample creates <tt>myTaxObject</tt> that has two properties: <tt>taxDeduction</tt> and the <tt>applyDeduction</tt>. The latter is a method with two parameters: array and a callback to be applied to this array.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var myTaxObject = {

    taxDeduction: 400, // state-specific  deduction

    // this function takes an array and callback as parameters
    applyDeduction: function(someArray, someCallBackFunction){

        for (var i = 0; i &lt; someArray.length; i++){

            // Invoke the callback
           someCallBackFunction.call(this, someArray[i]);
        }

    }
}

// array
var preliminaryTaxes=[1000, 2000, 3000];

// tax handler function
var taxHandler=function(currentTax){
                   console.log("Hello from callback. Your final tax is " +
                   (currentTax - this.taxDeduction));
                }

// invoking applyDeduction passing an array and callback
myTaxObject.applyDeduction(preliminaryTaxes, taxHandler);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The above code invokes <tt>applyDeduction()</tt> passing it the array <tt>preliminaryTaxes</tt> and the callback function <tt>taxHandler</tt> that takes the <tt>currentTax</tt> and subtracts <tt>this.taxDeduction</tt>. By the time this callback will be applied to each element of the array the value of <tt>this</tt> will be known and this code will print the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">Hello from callback. Your final tax is 600
Hello from callback. Your final tax is 1600
Hello from callback. Your final tax is 2600</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You may be wondering, why passing the function to another object if we could take an array, subtract 400 from each of its elements and be done with it? The solution with callbacks gives you an ability to make the decision on what function to call during the runtime and call it only when a certain event happens. Callbacks allow you to do asynchronous processing. For example, you make an asynchronous  request to a server and register the callback to be invoked if a result comes back. The code is not blocked and doesn&#8217;t wait until the server response is ready. Here&#8217;s an example from AJAX: <tt>request.onreadystatechange=myHandler</tt>. You register <tt>myHandler</tt> callback but not immediately call it. JavaScript functions are objects, so get used to the fact that you can pass them around as you&#8217;d be passing any objects.</p>

  <h4 id="_hoisting">Hoisting</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A variable scope depends on where it was declared.  You already had a chance to see that a variable declared inside a function with the keyword <tt>var</tt> is visible only inside this function. Some programming languages allow to narrow down the scope even further. For example, in Java declaring a variable inside any block of code surrounded with curly braces makes it visible only inside such a block. In JavaScript it works differently. No matter where in the function you declared the variable its declaration will be <em>hoisted</em> to the top of the function, and you can use this variable anywhere inside the function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The following code snippet will print 5 even though the variable b has been declared inside the if-statement. It&#8217;s declaration has been hoisted to the top:</p>

    }
    console.log(b);

}

test();</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s make a slight change to the above code to separate the variable declaration and initialization. The following code has to <tt>console.log(b)</tt> statements. The first one will output <tt>undefined</tt> and the second will print 5 just as in the previous example.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

    }

    b=5;

    console.log(b);  // b is visible and initialized
}

test();</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Due to hoisting, JavaScript doesn&#8217;t complain when the first <tt>console.log(b)</tt> is invoked. It knows about the variable <tt>b</tt>, but its value is <tt>undefined</tt> just yet. By the time the second <tt>console.log(b)</tt> is called, the variable b was initialized with the value of 5. Just remember that hoisting just applies to variable declaration and doesn&#8217;t interferes with your code when it comes to initialization.
JavaScript function declarations are hoisted too, and this is illustrated in the following code sample.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This code will print 5. We can call the function printB() here because its declaration was hoisted to the top. But the situation changes if instead of function declaration we&#8217;ll use the function expression. The following code will give you an error "PrintB is not a function". Notice that it the error doesn&#8217;t complain about <tt>printB</tt> being undefined cause the variable declaration was hoisted, but since the function expression wasn&#8217;t the JavaScript engine doesn&#8217;t know yet that <tt>printB</tt> will become a function really soon. Anyway, moving the invocation line <tt>printB()</tt> to the bottom of the function <tt>test()</tt> cures this issue. Function expressions are not being hoisted.</p>

  <p>Imagine a function that contains a private variable, and a nested function. Is it possible to invoke the nested function from the outside of the outer one? And if it&#8217;s possible, what this inner function knows about its surroundings?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Larry Ullman, a Web developer and computer books author offers the following definition: "Closure is a function call with memory". We can offer you our version: "Closure is a function call with strings attached". Now it&#8217;s turn for the explanation of these mysterious definitions, and we&#8217;ll do it by example. Consider the following code that is yet another example of implementing tax collection functionality.</p>

      	var yourTax;

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>First, a self-invoking function will create an anonymous instance of an object in the global scope. It contains a private variable <tt>taxDeduction</tt>, a public method <tt>doTaxes()</tt>, and a private method <tt>mafiaSpecial()</tt>. Just by the virtue of declaring <tt>doTaxes</tt> on <tt>this</tt> object, this method becomes exposed to the current scope, which is global in this example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After that we call the method <tt>doTaxes()</tt> twice. Note that the function <tt>doTaxes()</tt> uses the variable <tt>taxDeduction</tt> that was never declared there. But when <tt>doTaxes</tt> was initially declared, the variable <tt>taxDeduction</tt> with a value of 500 was already there. So the internal function "remembers" the context (the neighborhood) where it was declared and can use it for its calculations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The algorithm of tax calculations makes <tt>doTaxes()</tt> calls the function <tt>mafiaSpecial()</tt> if the customer&#8217;s name is "Tony Soprano". The function <tt>mafiaSpecial()</tt> is not visible from outside, but for insiders like <tt>doTaxes()</tt> it&#8217;s available.

        JavaScript doesn&#8217;t give you an explicit way to mark an variable as private.

  <p>The calculated taxes in this example are the same as in the previous one: John Smith has to pay $4500, while Tony Soprano only $4000. But we used different technique for exposing the closure. We want to make sure that you didn&#8217;t overlooked the parentheses at the very end of the function expression for <tt>doTaxes</tt>. These parenthesis force the anonymous function to self-invoke itself, it&#8217;ll run into a <tt>return</tt> statement and will assign the code of the anonymous inner function that takes parameter <tt>income</tt> to the property <tt>doTaxes</tt>. So when the line <tt>var result1 = p1.doTaxes(100000);</tt> calls the closure the variable <tt>result1</tt> will have the value 4500.

  <p>Let&#8217;s revisit the code from the section Callbacks above. That code has shown how to pass an arbitrary function to another one and invoke it there using <tt>call()</tt>. But if that version of the function <tt>taxHandler</tt> was not aware of the context it was created in, the version below will. If in classical object-oriented languages you&#8217;d need to pass a method that knows about it&#8217;s context, you&#8217;d need to create an instance of an object that contains the method and the required object-level properties, and then you&#8217;d be passing this wrapper-object to another object for processing. But since the closure remembers its context anyway, we can just pass a closure instead of object. Compare the code below with the code from the Callbacks section.</p>

  <p>The need to extend capabilities of objects can be fulfilled by inheritance, but this is not the only way of adding behavior to objects. In this section you&#8217;ll see an example of something that would not be possible in the object-oriented languages like Java or C#, which don&#8217;t support multiple inheritance. JavaScript allows taking a piece of code and <em>mix it into any object</em> regardless of what its inheritance chain is. <em>Mixin</em> is a code fragment that an object can borrow if need be.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After learning all these facts and techniques about the language you might be eager to see "the real-world use of JavaScript". Slowly but surely a Web browser becomes the leading platform for development of the user interface.  The vast majority today&#8217;s JavaScript programs primarily manipulate HTML elements of Web pages. In this section we&#8217;ll be doing exactly this – applying JavaScript code to modify the content or style of HTML elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It&#8217;s an object representing the hierarchy of HTML elements of a  Web page. Every element of the HTML document is loaded into DOM. Each DOM element has a reference to its children and siblings. When DOM was invented, the Web pages were simple and static. DOM was not meant to be an object actively accessed by the code. This is the reason that on some of the heavily populated Web pages manipulating of DOM elements can be slow. Most likely DOM is the main target for anyone who&#8217;s trying to optimize the performance of a Web page.</p>

      <p>Communicating with the server side, e.g. submitting forms or making AJAX requests for some data from the server</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now you&#8217;ll see some code samples illustrating the use of JavaScript for the listed above operations. Even if you’ll be using one of the popular JavaScript frameworks, your program will be performing similar operations applying the syntax prescribed by your framework of choice. So let&#8217;s learn how it can be done.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_working_with_dom">Working with DOM</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you want to change the appearance of an HTML page, you need to manipulate with the DOM elements. Older Web applications were preparing the HTML content on the server side. For example, a server-side Java servlet would compose and send to the client HTML whenever the application logic required to change the appearance of the UI. The current trend is different - the client&#8217;s code takes care of the UI rendering, and only the data go back and forth between the client and the server. You&#8217;ll see how this works in more detail in Chapter 4 that explains the use of AJAX and JSON.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Earlier in this chapter we were talking about the global namespace where all JavaScript objects live unless they were declared with <tt>var</tt> inside the functions. If the JavaScript code is running in a Web browser, this global namespace is represented by a special variable <tt>window</tt>. It&#8217;s an implicit variable and you don&#8217;t have to use it in your code, but whenever we say that a variable is global, we mean that it&#8217;s exists on the <tt>window</tt> object. For example, the code below will print "123 Main Street" twice:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var address ="123 Main Street";

console.log(address);
console.log(window.address);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>window</tt> object has a number of useful properties like <tt>cookie</tt>, <tt>location</tt>, <tt>parent</tt>, <tt>document</tt> and others.  The variable <tt>document</tt> points at the root of the DOM hierarchy. Pretty often your  JavaScript code would find an element in the DOM first, and then it could read or modify its content.

  <p>Have you ever seen a monitor of a trader working for a Wall Street firm? Actually, they usually have three or four large monitors, but let&#8217;s just look at one of them. Imagine a busy screen with lots and lots constantly changing data grouped in dedicated areas of the window. This screen shows the constantly changing prices from financial markets, the trader can place orders to buy or sell products, and notifications on completed trades are also coming to the same screen. If this is would be a Web application it would live in the same Web page. No menus to open another windows.</p>

  <p>The price of Apple share was $590.45 just a second ago and now it&#8217;s $590.60. How can this be done technically? Here&#8217;s one of the possibilities: every second an AJAX is being made to the remote server providing current stock prices and the JavaScript code finds in the DOM the HTML element responsible for rendering the price and then modifies its value with the latest price.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Have you seen a Web page showing an input box of Google&#8217;s Gmail? It looks like a table with a list of rows representing the sender, subject, and the date of when each email arrived. All of a sudden you see a new row in bold on top of the list - the new email came in. How was this done technically? A new object(s) was created and inserted into a DOM tree. No page changes, no needs for the user to refresh the browser&#8217;s page - an undercover AJAX call gets the data and JavaScript changes the DOM. The content of DOM changed - the user sees an updated value.</p>

  <p>Note the input field of type <tt>button</tt>, which includes the <tt>onclick</tt> property that corresponds to the <tt>click</tt> event. When the user clicks on the button, the browser dispatched <tt>click</tt> event, and calls the JavaScript function <tt>setEmployeeOfTheMonth()</tt>. The latter queries the DOM and finds the reference to the  <tt>emp</tt> by calling the method <tt>getElementBuId()</tt>. After that, the method <tt>getElementByTagName()</tt> is called trying to find all the references to the HTML <tt>&lt;input&gt;</tt> elements. This methods returns an array cause there could be more than one element with the same tag name on a page, which explains the use of array notation. The first <tt>&lt;input&gt;</tt> element is a button and the second is the text field we&#8217;re interested in.

  <p>While some of the output is self-explanatory, there is a number of <tt>#text</tt> nodes that you won&#8217;t find in the code sample above. Unfortunately, Web browsers treat whitespaces differently, and inserts different number of text nodes in the DOM representing whitespaces found in the HTML document. So you&#8217;ll be better off using one of the JavaScript frameworks for traversing the DOM cross-browser way.

  <p>You can include CSS into a Web page either by linking to separate files using the HTML tag <tt>&lt;link&gt;</tt> or by in-lining the styles with the tag <tt>&lt;style&gt;</tt>. For example, if CSS is located in the file <tt>mystyles.css</tt> in
the folder css add the following tag to HTML:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">

  <p>The <tt>&lt;link&gt;</tt> tag allows specifying the media where specific css file has to be used. For example, you can have one CSS file for smartphones and another one for tablets. We’ll discuss this in detail in the section on media queries in Chapter 11.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You should put this tag in the section of your HTML before any JavaScript code to make sure that they

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Placing the <tt>@import</tt> attribute inside the <tt>&lt;style&gt;</tt> tag allows to include styles located elsewhere:</p>

consists of many files, the Web browser will have to make multiple round trips to your server just to load all resources required by the HTML document, which can worsen the responsiveness of your Web application.</p>
</div>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>HTML documents are often prettyfied by using CSS class selectors, and you can switch them  programmatically with JavaScript.  Imagine that a <tt>&lt;style&gt;</tt> section has the following definition of two class selectors <tt>badStyle</tt> and <tt>niceStile</tt>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="css">   &lt;style&gt;
   	 .badStyle{
      	font-family: Verdana;
      	font-size:small;
      	color:navy;
      	background-color:red;
    }

    .niceStyle{
      	font-family: Verdana;
      	font-size:large;
      	font-style:italic;
      	color:gray;
      	background-color:green;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Any of these class selectors can be used by one or more HTML elements, for example</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;div id="header" class="badStyle"&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;This is my header&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Imagine that some important event has happened and the appearance the <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt> styled as <tt>badStyle</tt> should programmatically change to &lt;niceStyle&gt;. In this case we need to find the <tt>badStyle</tt> element(s) first and change their style. The method <tt>getElementsByClassName()</tt> returns a set of elements that have the specified class name, and since our HTML has only one such element, the JavaScript will use the element zero from such set:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">   	  document.getElementsByClassName("badStyle")[0].className="niceStyle";</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The next example will illustrate adding a new element to the DOM. On click of a button the code below dynamically creates an instance of type <tt>img</tt> and then assigns the location of the image to its <tt>src</tt> element. In a similar way we could have assigned values to any other attributes of the <tt>img</tt> element like <tt>width</tt>, <tt>height</tt>, or <tt>alt</tt>. The method <tt>appendChild()</tt> is applied to the &lt;body&gt; container, but it could be any other container that exists on the DOM.</p>

  <h4 id="_dom_events">DOM Events</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Web browser will  notify your application when some changes or interactions occur. In such cases the browser will dispatch an appropriate event, for example <tt>load</tt>, <tt>unload</tt>, <tt>mousemove</tt>, <tt>click</tt>, <tt>keydown</tt> etc. When the Web page finished loading the browser will dispatch the <tt>load</tt> event. When the user will click on the button on a Web page the <tt>click</tt> event will be dispatched. A Web developer needs to provide JavaScript code that will react on the events important to the application. The browser events will occur regardless of if you provided the code to handle them or not. It&#8217;s important to understand some terms related to event processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>An <em>event handler (a.k.a. event listener)</em> is a JavaScript code you want to be called as a response to this event. The last code sample from the previous section was processing the <tt>click</tt> event on the button "Show me" as follows: <tt>onclick="setEmployeeOfTheMonth()"</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock">
  <table>

      <td class="content">
        
        Each HTML element has a certain number of predefined <em>event attributes</em>, which start with the prefix <tt>on</tt> followed by the name of the event. For example <tt>onclick</tt> is an event attribute that you can use for specifying the handler for the <tt>click</tt> event. You can find out what event attributes are available in the online document titled <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events//">Document Object Model Events</a>.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The preferred way of adding event listener was introduced in the DOM Level 2 specification back in 2000. You should find the HTML element in the DOM, and then assign the event listener to it by calling the method <tt>addEventListener()</tt>.  For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", setEmployeeOfTheMonth);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The advantage of using of such programmatic assignment of event listeners is that this can be done for all controls in a in a central place, for example in a JavaScript function that runs immediately after the Web page completes loading. Another advantage is that you can programmatically remove the event listener if it&#8217;s not needed any longer by invoking <tt>removeEventListener()</tt>. The following example is a re-write of the last example from the previous section.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;Employee of the month&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
             &lt;input type="button" value="Show me" id="myButton"/&gt; &lt;!-- <b>&lt;1&gt;</b> --&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;script&gt;
         window.onload=function(){         // <b>&lt;2&gt;</b>
         	document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click",
           	                                      setEmployeeOfTheMonth);
         }

         function setEmployeeOfTheMonth(){

           // Create an image and add it to the &lt;body&gt; element
           var empImage=document.createElement("img");
        	   empImage.setAttribute('src','resources/images/employee.jpg');
        	   document.body.appendChild(empImage);

        	 document.getElementById("myButton").removeEventListener("click",
           	                                 setEmployeeOfTheMonth); // <b>&lt;3&gt;</b>
        	}

     &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
  
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>
      <p>Compare this button with the one from the previous section: the event handler is removed, but it has an ID now.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>When the Web page completes loading, a <tt>load</tt> event is dispatched and the function attached to the event attribute <tt>onload</tt> assigns the event handler for the button <em>click</em> event. Note that we are passing the callback <tt>setEmployeeOfTheMonth</tt> as the second argument of the <tt>addEventListener()</tt></p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Removing the event listener after the image of the employee of the month has been added. Without this line each click on the button would add to the Web page yet another copy of the same image.</p>
    </li>
  
  </ol>
  
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Each event goes through three different phases: <em>Capture, Target, and Bubble</em>. It&#8217;s easier to explain this concept by example. Imagine that a button is located inside the <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt>, which is located inside the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> container. When you click on the button, the event travels to the button through all enclosing containers, and this is the capture phase. You can intercept the event at one of these containers even before it reached the button if need be. For example, your application logic may need to prevent the button from being clicked if certain condition occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Then event reaches the button, and it&#8217;s a target phase. After the event is handled by the button&#8217;s <tt>click</tt> handler, the event bubbles up through the enclosing containers, and this is the bubble phase. you can create listeners and handle this event after the button finished its processing at the target phase. The next code sample is based on the previous one, but it demonstrates the event processing in all three phases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Note that if your event handler function is declared with the event parameter, it&#8217;ll receive the <tt>Event</tt> object, which contains a number of useful parameters. For more information refer to the "Document Object Model Events" online.</p>

  <h3 id="_summary_2">Summary</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This chapter was covering the JavaScript language constructs that any professional Web developer should know. A smaller portion of this chapter was illustrating how to combine JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are lots of online resources and books that cover just the HTML markup and CSS, and you&#8217;ll definitely need to spend more time mastering details of the Web tools like Firebug or Google Developer Tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Software developers who are coming from strongly-typed compiled languages may have a feeling that their productivity drops with JavaScript. We can recommend several medications for this. FIrst, get familiar with the language calls CoffeeScript. As a respected Java developer James Ward put it, "CoffeeScript is a way to write JavaScript". This language is very similar to JavaScript and is very easy to learn if you understand the JavaScript syntax, it supports classes and is compiled into clean JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Another interesting language to learn is Microsoft&#8217;s TypeScript (it&#8217;s an open source project). This language is also an extension of JavaScript with added classes, interfaces and inheritance. If also gets compiled into JavaScript and allows developers write strongly-typed code. TypeScript increases productivity of developers because it helps identify lots of error related with incorrect types during the compilation phase.  TypeScript implements many constructs from EcmaScript 6 and can be serve as an example of the JavaScript of the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The third not-to-be-missed language is Google&#8217;s Dart. This is a compiled language that runs inside the VM, and Google supports it on both on the client and on the server. What about the other browsers? The Web application is deployed as a script that automatically checks if the the browser supports Dart. If yes - the compiled code will be sent to the client, if not - the dart code will be automatically compiled into JavaScript, and from the browser point&#8217;s of view nothing but a JavaScrpit engine is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>WebStorm IDE supports Coffeescript, Dart, and Typescript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

  <p>This chapter is a brief review of selected HTML5 APIs. HTML5 is just a commonly used term for a combination of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and several new APIs that appeared during the last several years. Five years ago people were using the term <em>Web 2.0</em> to define modern looking applications. These days HTML5 is almost a household name, and we&#8217;ll go along with it. But HTML5 is about the same old development in JavaScript plus latest advances in HTML and CSS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This chapter differs from all others because it includes a little less code, and is more of an overview of selected APIs that are included in HTML5 specification, namely Web Storage, offline Web applications, Web Workers, and History API.</p>

  <p>The majority of the modern Web browsers already support the current version of <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/workers.html#workers">HTML5 specification</a>, which will become a W3C standard in 2014. The question is if the users of your Web application have a modern browser installed on their device? There are two groups of users that will stick to the outdated browsers for some time:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p>Computer illiterate people who are afraid of installing any new software one their PCs, especially, people of the older generation. <em>"John, after the last visit of our grandson our computer works even slower than before. Please don&#8217;t let him install these new fancy browsers here. I just need my old Internet Explorer, access to Hotmail and Facebook".</em></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Business users working for large corporations, where all the installations of the software on their PCs is done by a dedicated technical support team. They say, <em>"We have 50000 PCs in or firm. An upgrade from Internet Explorer version 8 to version 9 is a major undertaking. Internal users work with hundreds Web applications on a regular basis. They can install whatever browser they want, but if some of these applications won&#8217;t work as expected, the users will flood us with support requests we&#8217;re not qualified to resolve</em> . Hence the strategy of using the lowest denominator browser often wins.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Often Web developers need to make both of the above groups of users happy. Take an online banking - an old couple has to be able to use your Web application from their old PCs otherwise they can transfer their lifetime savings to a different bank which doesn&#8217;t require, say the latest version of Firefox installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Does it mean that enterprise Web developers shouldn&#8217;t even bother using HTML5 that&#8217;s not 100% supported? Not at all. This means that a substantial portion of their application&#8217;s code will be bloated with if-statements figuring out what this specific Web browser supports and providing several solutions that keep your application on float in any Web browser. This what makes the job of DHTML developers a lot more difficult than of, say Java or .Net developers who know exactly the VM where their code will work. If you don&#8217;t install the Java Runtime of version 1.6 our application won&#8217;t work. As simple as that. How about asking Java developers writing applications that will work in any runtime released during the last 10 years? No, we&#8217;re not that nasty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Do you believe it would be a good idea for Amazon or Facebook to re-write their UI in Java? Of course not unless they want to loose most of their customers who will be scared to death after seeing the message of the 20-step Java installer asking for the access to the internals of their computer. Each author of this book is a Java developer, and we love using Java&#8230; on the server side. But when it comes to the consumer facing Web applications there are better than Java choices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The bottom line is that we have to learn how to develop Web applications that won&#8217;t require installing any new software on the user&#8217;s machines. In the Web browsers it&#8217;s DHTML or in the modern terminology it&#8217;s HTML5 stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the unfortunate event of needing to support both new and old HTML and CSS implementations you can use <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> that is not a framework, but a template for creating a new HTML project that will support HTML5 and CSS3 elements but will work even in the hostile environments of the older browsers. It&#8217;s like broadcasting a TV show in HD, but letting the cavemen with the 50-year old black-and-white tubes watching it too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>HTML Boilerplate comes with a simple way to start your project pre-packaged with solutions and workarounds offered by well known gurus in the industry. Make no mistake, your code base may be larger that you wanted - for example, the initial CSS starts with 500 lines accommodating the old and new browsers, but it may be your safety net.</p>

  <p>This chapter is about selected HTML APIs that we find important to understand in Web applications. But before using any of the API&#8217;s listed here you want to check if the versions of the Web browsers you have to user support these APIs. The Web site <a href="http://caniuse.com">http://caniuse.com</a> will give you the up-to-date information about all major browsers and their versions that do (or don&#8217;t) support the API in question. For example, to see which browsers support Worker API visit <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=Worker">caniuse.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>It&#8217;s a good practice to include in your code a line that test it an API is supported. For example, if the following if-statement returns false, the Web Worker is not supported and the code should fallback to a single-threaded processing mode:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">if (window.Worker) {
   // create a Worker instance to execute your
   // script in a separate thread
) else{
	// tough luck, fallback to a single–threaded mode
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In Chapter 3 you&#8217;ll learn about the feature-detection tool <em>Modernizr</em> that allows to programmatically check if any particular HTML5 API is supported by the browser being used.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">if (Modernizr.Worker) {
   // create a Worker instance to execute your
   // script in a separate thread
)</code></pre>

  <h3 id="_html5_web_messaging">HTML5 Web Messaging</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webmessaging/">HTML5 Web Messaging</a> allows you to arrange for communication between different Web pages of the same Web application. More officially, it&#8217;s about "communicating between browsing contexts in HTML documents". Web messaging also allows you to work around <em>the same domain policy</em> that would result in security error if a window A has one origin (the combination of URL scheme, host name and port, e.g. <a href="http://myserver.com:8080">http://myserver.com:8080</a>) would try to access property of a window B that was downloaded from another origin. But with messaging API windows downloaded from different origins can send messages to each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The API is pretty straightforward: if a script in <tt>WindowA</tt> has a reference to <tt>WindowB</tt> where you want to send a message, invoke the following method:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript"> myWindowB.postMesage(someData, targetOrigin);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The object referenced by <tt>myWindowB</tt> will receive an event object with the content of payload <tt>someData</tt> in the event&#8217;s property <tt>data</tt>.  The <tt>targetOrigin</tt> specifies the origin where <tt>myWindowB</tt> was downloaded from. Specifying a concrete URI of the destination window in <tt>targetOrigin</tt> is the right way to do messaging. This way if a malicious site will try to intercept the message it won&#8217;t be delivered since the URI specified in <tt>targetOrigin</tt> would be different from the malicious site&#8217;s URI. But if you&#8217;re absolutely sure that your application is operating in absolutely safe environment, you can specify <tt>"*"</tt> as <tt>targetOrigin</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Accordingly, <tt>myWindowB</tt> has to define an event handler for processing of this external event <tt>message</tt>, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">window.addEventListener('message', myEventHanler, false);

function myEventHandler(event){
	console.log(`Received something: ` + event.data);
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s consider an example where an HTML Window creates an iFrame and needs to communicate with it. In particular, the iFrame will notify the main window that it has loaded, and the main window will acknowledge receiving of this message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The iFrame will have two button emulating the case of some trading system with two buttons: Buy and Sell. When the use clicks on one of these iFrame&#8217;s buttons the main window has to confirm receiving of the buy or sell request. <a href="#FIG1-1">Message exchange between the window and iFrame</a> is a snapshot from a Chrome browser where Developers Tools panel

  <p>If you&#8217;ll need to build a UI of the application from reusable components, applying messaging techniques allows you to create loosely coupled components. Say you&#8217;ve created a window for a financial trader. This windows get the data push from the server showing the latest stock prices. When the trader likes the price he may click on the Buy or Sell button to initiate a trade. The trading engine can be is implemented in a separate  window and establishing inter-window communications in a loosely coupled manner is really important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Three years ago O&#8217;Reilly has published another book written by us. That book was titled "Enterprise Development with Flex", and in particular, we&#8217;ve described there how to apply the Mediator design pattern for creating a UI where components can communication with each other by sending-receiving events from the mediator object.  The Mediator pattern remains very important in developing UI using any technologies or programming languages, and importance of the HTML5 messaging can&#8217;t be underestimated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a href="#FIG1-2">Before and after the trader clicked on the Price Panel</a> is an illustration from that Enterprise Flex book. The Pricing Panel on the left gets the data feed about the current prices of the IBM stock. When the user clicks on Bid or Ask panel, the Pricing Panel just sends the event with the relevant information like JSON-formatted string containing the stock symbol, price, buy or sell flag, date, etc. In HTML5 realm, we can say that the Pricing Panel invokes <tt>parent.postMessage()</tt> and shoots the message to the mediator (a.k.a. main window).</p>

  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 25. Before and after the trader clicked on the Price Panel</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Mediator receives the message and re-post it to its another child - the Order Panel that knows how to place orders to purchase stocks. The main takeaway from such design is that the Pricing and Order panels do not know about each other and are communication by sending-receiving messages to/from a mediator. Such a loosely coupled design allows reuse the same code in different applications. For example, the Pricing Panel can be reused in some portal that&#8217;s used by a company executives in a dashboard showing prices without the need to place orders. Since the Price Panel has no string attached to Order Panel, it&#8217;s easy to reuse the existing code in such a dashboard.</p>

    <div class="title">HTML5 Forms</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>While this chapter is about selected HTML APIs, we&#8217;ve decided to bring your attention to the improvements in the HTML5 <tt>&lt;form&gt;</tt> tag too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine an enterprise Web application that is not using forms. At the very minimum the Contact Us form has to be there. A login view is yet another example of the HTML form that almost every enterprise application needs. People fill out billing and shipping forms, they answer long questionnaires while purchasing insurance policies online. HTML5 includes some very useful additions that simplify working with forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We&#8217;ll start with the prompts. Showing the hints or prompts right inside the input field will save you some screen space. HTML5 has a special attribute <tt>placeholder</tt>. The text placed in this attribute will be shown inside the field until it gets the focus - then the text disappears. You&#8217;ll see the use of placeholder attribute in Chapter 3 in the logging part of our sample application.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;input id="username" name="username" type="text"
                      placeholder="username" autofocus/&gt;

&lt;input id="password" name="password"
          type="password" placeholder="password"/&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Another useful attribute is <tt>autofocus</tt>, which automatically places the focus in the field with this attribute. In the above HTML snippet the focus will be automatically placed in the field <tt>username</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>HTML5 introduces a number of new input types, and many of them have huge impact on the look and feel of the UI on mobile devices. Below are brief explanations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the input type is <tt>date</tt>, in mobile devices it&#8217;ll show native looking date pickers when the focus gets into this field. In desktop computers you&#8217;ll see a little stepper icon to allow the user select the next or previous month, day, or year without typing. Besides <tt>date</tt> you can also specify such types as <tt>datetime</tt>, <tt>week</tt>, <tt>month</tt>, <tt>time</tt>, <tt>datetime-local</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the input type is <tt>email</tt>, the main view of the virtual keyboard on your smartphone will include the <em>@</em> key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the input type is <tt>url</tt>, the main virtual keyboard will include the buttons <em>.com</em>, <em>.</em>, and <em>/</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>tel</tt> type will automatically validate telephone numbers for the right format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>color</tt> type opens up a color picker control to select the color. After selection, the hexadecimal representation of the color becomes the <tt>value</tt> of this input field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The input type <tt>range</tt> shows a slider, and you can specify its <tt>min</tt> and <tt>max</tt> values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>number</tt> type shows a numeric stepper icon on the right side of the input field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the type is <tt>search</tt>, at the very minimum you&#8217;ll see a little cross on the right of this input field. It allows the user quickly clear the field. On mobile devices, bringing the focus to the search field brings up a virtual keyboard with the Search button. Consider adding the attributes <tt>placeholder</tt> and <tt>autofocus</tt> to the search field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the browser doesn&#8217;t support new input type, it&#8217;ll render it as a text field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To validate the input values, use the <tt>required</tt> attribute. It doesn&#8217;t include any logic, but won&#8217;t allow submitting the form until the input field marked as <tt>required</tt> has something in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>pattern</tt> attribute allows you to write a regular expression that ensures that the field contains certain symbols or words. For example, adding <tt>pattern="http:.+"</tt> won&#8217;t consider the input data valid, unless it starts with <tt>http://</tt> followed by one or more characters, one of which has to be period. It&#8217;s a good idea to include a <tt>pattern</tt> attribute with a regular expression most of the input fields.</p>

  <h3 id="_web_workers">Web Workers</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When you start a Web Browser or any other application on your computer or other device, you start <em>a task</em> or <em>a process</em>. <em>A thread</em> is a lighter process within another process. While JavaScript doesn&#8217;t support multi-threaded mode, HTML5 has a way to run a script as a separate thread in background.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A typical Web application has a UI part (HTML) and a processing part (JavaScript). If a user clicks on a button, which starts a JavaScript function that runs, say for a hundred mili-seconds, there won&#8217;t be any noticeable delays in user interaction. But if the JavaScript will run a couple of seconds, user experience will suffer. In some cases the Web browser will assume that the script became <em>unresponsive</em> and will offer the user to kill it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Imagine an HTML5 game where a click on the button has to do some major recalculation of coordinates and repainting of multiple images in the browser&#8217;s window. Ideally, we&#8217;d like to parallelize the execution of UI interactions and background JavaScript functions as much as possible, so the user won&#8217;t notice any delays.  Another example is a CPU-intensive spell checker function that find errors while the user keeps typing. Parsing JSON object is yet another candidate to be done in background. Polling a server for some data is yet another use case where Web workers fit well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In other words, use Web workers when you want to be able to run multiple parallel <em>threads of execution</em> within the same task.
On a multi-processor computer parallel threads can run on different CPU’s.On a single-processor computer, threads will take turn in getting <em>slices</em> of CPU&#8217;s time. Since switching CPU cycles between threads happens fast, the user won’t notice tiny delays in each thread’s execution getting a feeling of smooth interaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_creating_and_communicating_with_workers">Creating and Communicating with Workers</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>HTML5 offers <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/workers.html#workers">a solution</a> for multi-threaded execution of a script with the help of the <tt>Worker</tt> object. To start a separate thread of execution you&#8217;ll need to create an instance of a <tt>Worker</tt> object passing it the name of the file with the script to run in a separate thread, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var mySpellChecker = new Worker(spellChecker.js);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>Worker</tt> thread runs asynchronously and can&#8217;t directly communicate with the UI components (i.e. DOM elements) of the browser. When the <tt>Worker`s script finishes execution, it can send back a message using the `postMessage()</tt> method. Accordingly, the script that created the worker thread can listen for the event from the worker and process its responses in the event handler. Such event object will contain the data received from the worker in its property <tt>data</tt>, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var mySpellChecker = new Worker(spellChecker.js);
    mySpellChecker.onmessage = function(event){

        // processing the worker's response
        document.getElementById('myEditorArea').textContent = event.data;
    };</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You can use an alternative and preferred JavaScript function <tt>addEventListener()</tt> to assign the message handler:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var mySpellChecker = new Worker(spellChecker.js);
    mySpellChecker.addEventListener("message", function(event){

        // processing the worker's response
        document.getElementById('myEditorArea').textContent = event.data;
    });</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>On the other hand, the HTML page can also send any message to the worker forcing it to start performing its duties like start the spell checking process:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">    mySpellChecker.postMessage(wordToCheckSpelling);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The argument of <tt>postMessage()</tt> can contain any object, and it&#8217;s  being passed by value, not by reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Inside the worker you also need to define an event handler to process the data sent from outside. To continue the previous example the spellChecker.js will have inside the code that receives the text to check, performs the spell check, and returns the result back:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">self.onmesage = function(event){

     // The code that performs spell check goes here

	 var resultOfSpellCheck = checkSpelling(event.data);

     // Send the results back to the window that listens
     // for the messages from this spell checker

	 self.postMessage(resultOfSpellCheck);
};</code></pre>

  <p>If you want to run a certain code in the background repeatedly, you can create a wrapper function (e.g. <tt>doSpellCheck()</tt>) that internally invokes <tt>postMesage()</tt> and then gives such a wrapper to <tt>setTimeout()</tt> or <tt>setInterval()`to run every second or so: `var timer = setTimout(doSpellCheck, 1000);</tt>.</p>

  <p>If an error occurs in a worker thread, your Web application will get a notification in a form of an event, and you need to provide a function handler for <tt>onerror</tt>:</p>

  <div class="content monospaced">

  <h4 id="_dedicated_and_shared_workers">Dedicated and Shared Workers</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If a window&#8217;s script creates a worker thread for its own use, we call it <em>a dedicated worker</em>.  A window creates an event listener, which gets the messages from the worker. On the other hand, the worker can have a listener too to react to the events received from its creator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A <em>shared worker</em> thread can be used by several scripts as long as they have the same origin. For example, if you want to reuse a spell checker feature in several views of your Web application, you can create a shared worker as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var mySpellChecker = new SharedWorker(spellChecker.js);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Another use case is funneling all requests from multiple windows to the server through a shared worker. You can also place into a shared worker a number of reusable utility function that may be needed in several windows - such architecture can reduce or eliminate repeatable code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>One or more scripts can communicate with a shared worker, and it&#8217;s done slightly different that with the dedicated one. Communication is done through the <tt>port</tt> property and the <tt>start()</tt> method has to be invoked to be able to use <tt>postMessage()</tt> first time:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var mySpellChecker = new SharedWorker(spellChecker.js);
    mySpellChecker.port.addEventListener("message", function(event){
        document.getElementById('myEditorArea').textContent = event.data;
    });
    mySpellChecker.port.start()</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The event handler becomes connected to the <tt>port</tt> property, and now you can post the message to this shared worker using the same <tt>postMessage()</tt> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">    mySpellChecker.postMessage(wordToCheckSpelling);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Each new script that will connect to the shared worker by attaching an event handler to the port results in incrementing the number of active connections that the shared worker maintains.  If the script of the shared worker will invoke <tt>port.postMessage("Hello scripts!")</tt>, all listeners that are connected to this port will get it.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock">

      <td class="content">
        
        if a shared thread is interesting in processing the moments when a new script connects to it, add an event listener to the <tt>connect</tt> event in the code of the shared worker.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If a worker needs to stop communicating with the external world it can call <tt>self.close()</tt>. The external script can kill the worker thread by calling the method <tt>terminate()</tt>, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">mySpellChecker.terminate();</code></pre>

      <td class="content">
        
        Since the script running inside the <tt>Worker</tt> thread doesn&#8217;t have access to the browser&#8217;s UI components, you can&#8217;t debug such scripts by printing messages onto browser&#8217;s console with <tt>console.log()</tt>. But the Chrome Browser includes the <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2012/04/debugging-web-workers-with-chrome.html"><em>Workers</em> panel</a> that can be used for debugging the code that&#8217;s launched in worker threads. You&#8217;ll see multiple examples of using Chrome Developers Tools starting from Chapter 2.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Authors of this book believe that WebSocket API is so important, that we dedicated the entire Chapter 9 of this book to this API. In this section we&#8217;ll just introduce this API very briefly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>While HTTP is a request-response based protocol, WebSocket is a bi-directional full-duplex socket-based protocol. This is how it works:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>A Web application establish a socket connection between the client and the server using HTTP for the initial handshake.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The server switches the communication protocol from HTTP to a socket-based protocol.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>From this point on both client and server can send messages in both directions simultaneously (i.e. in full duplex mode).</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>This is not a request-response model as both the server and the client can initiate the data transmission which enables the real server-side push.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Both the server and the client can initiate disconnects too.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This is a very short description of what WebSocket API is about. We encourage you to read Chapter 9 and find the use of this great API in one of your projects.</p>

  <h3 id="_offline_web_applications">Offline Web Applications</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The common misconception about Web applications is that they are useless if there is no connection to the Internet. Everyone knows that native application can be written in a way that they have everything they need installed on your device&#8217;s data storage - both the application code and the data storage.  With HTML5, Web applications can be designed to be functional even when the user&#8217;s device is disconnected. The offline version of a Web application may not offer full functionality, but certain functions can still be available.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_prerequisites_for_developing_offline_web_applications">Prerequisites for developing Offline Web Applications</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To be useful in a disconnected mode, HTML-based application needs to have access to some local storage on the device, in which case the data entered by the user in the HTML windows can be saved locally with further synchronization with the server when connection becomes available. Think of a salesman of a pharmaceutical visiting medical offices trying to sell new pills. What if connection is not available at certain point? She can still use her tablet demonstrate the marketing materials and more importantly, collect some data about this visit and save them locally. When the Internet connection becomes  available again, the Web application should support automatic or manual data synchronization so the information about the salesman activity will be stored in a central database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Having a local storage accessible from HTML/JavaScript UI is a prerequisite for building offline Web applications. The other important design decision is to ensure that the server sends to the client only the data, no HTML markup (see <a href="#FIG1-3">Design with Offline Use in Mind</a>). So all these server-side frameworks that prepare the data heavily sprinkled with HTML markup should not be used. For example, the front-end should be developed in HTML/JavaScript/CSS, the back end in your favorite language (Java, .Net, PHP, etc.), and the JSON-formatted data are being sent from the server to the client and back.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG1-3" class="imageblock">

    <img src="images/fig_01_03.png" alt="fig_01_03">
    
  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 26. Design with Offline Use in Mind</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The business logic that supports the client&#8217;s offline functionality should be developed in JavaScript and run in the Web browser. While most of the business logic of Web applications remains on the server side, the Web client is not as thin as it used to be in legacy HTML-based applications. The client becomes fatter and it can have state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>It&#8217;s a good idea to create a data layer in your JavaScript code that will be responsible for all data communications. If the Internet connection is available, the data layer will be making  requests to the server, otherwise it&#8217;ll get the data from the local storage.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_application_cache">Application Cache</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The goal is to have your Web application running even if there is no Internet connection. The user will still go to her browser and enter the URL, but the trick is that the main and some other Web pages were saved locally in the application cache. So even if you&#8217;re not online, the application will start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If your Web application consists of multiple files, you need to specify in <em>Cache Manifest</em> those files that have to be present on the user&#8217;s computer in the offline mode. Cache Manifest is a plain text file that lists such resources. Storing some resources in the application cache can be a good idea not only in the disconnected mode, but also to lower the amount of code that has to be downloaded from the server each time the user starts your application. Here&#8217;s an example of the file mycache.manifest, which includes one CSS file, two JavaScript files, and one image to be stored locally on the user&#8217;s computer:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">CACHE MANIFEST
/resources/css/main.css
/js/app.js
/js/customer_form.js
/resources/images/header_image.png</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The manifest file has to start with the line CACHE MANIFEST and can be optionally divided into sections. If there is no sections (as in our example)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The landing page of your Web application has to specify an explicit reference to the location of the manifest. If the above file is located in the document root directory of your application, the main HTML file can refer to the manifest as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en" manifest="/mycache.manifest"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Web server must serve the manifest file with a MIME type "text/cache-manifest", and you need to refer to the documentation of your Web server to see how to see where to make a configuration change so all files with extension .manifest are served as "text/cache-manifest".</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_is_your_application_offline">Is Your Application Offline?</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Web browsers have a <tt>boolean</tt> property <tt>window.navigator.onLine</tt>, which should be used to check if there is no connection to the Internet. The HTML5 specification states that <em>"The navigator.onLine attribute must return false if the user agent will not contact the network when the user follows links or when a script requests a remote page (or knows that such an attempt would fail), and must return true otherwise."</em> Unfortunately, major Web browsers deal with this property differently so you need to do a thorough testing to see if it works as expected with the browser you care about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To intercept the changes in the connectivity status, you can also assign event listeners to the <tt>online</tt> and <tt>offline</tt> events, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">window.addEventListener("offline", function(e) {
    // The code to be used in the offline mode goes here
});

window.addEventListener("online", function(e) {
    // The code to synchronize the data saved in the offline mode
    // (if any) goes here
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You can also add the <tt>onoffline</tt> and <tt>ononline</tt> event handlers to the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> tag of your HTML page or to the <tt>document</tt> object. Again, test the support of these event in your browsers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>What if the browser&#8217;s support of the offline/online events is still not stable? In this you&#8217;ll have to write your own script that will periodically make an AJAX call (see Chapter 4) trying to connect to a remote server that&#8217;s always up and running, e.g. google.com. If this request fails, it&#8217;s a good indication that your application is disconnected from the Internet.</p>

  <h4 id="_options_for_storing_data_locally">Options for Storing Data Locally</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the past, Web browsers could only store their own cache and application&#8217;s cookies on the user&#8217;s computer. Cookies are small files (up to 4Kb) that a Web browser would automatically save locally if the server&#8217;s <tt>HTTPResponse</tt> would include them. On the next visit of the same URL, the Web browser would send all non-expired cookies back to the browser as a part of <tt>HTTPRequest</tt> object. Cookies were used for arranging HTTP session management and couldn&#8217;t be considered a solution for setting up a local storage. HTML5 offers a lot more advanced solutions for storing data locally, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">Web Storage</a> that includes Local Storage and Session Storage.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">IndexedDB</a>: a NoSQL database that stores key-value pairs.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There is another option worth mentioning - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/">Web SQL Database</a>. The specification was based on the open source SQLite database, which probably was the wrong decision in the foirst place.  But the work on this specification is stopped and future versions of the browsers may not support it. That&#8217;s why we are not going to discuss Web SQL Database in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>At the time of this writing (Summer of 2013) local and session storage are supported by all modern Web browsers. Web SQL database is not supported by Firefox and Internet Explorer and most likely will never be. IndexedDB is the Web storage format of the future, but Safari doesn&#8217;t support it yet, so if your main development platform is iOS, you may need to stick to Web SQL database. Consider using a polyfill for indexedDB using Web SQL API called <a href="https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim">IndexedDBShim</a>.</p>

        While Web browsers send cookies to the Web server, they  don&#8217;t send there the data saved in a local storage. The saved data is used only on the user&#8217;s device. Also, the data saved in the local storage never expire. A Web application has to programmatically clean up the storage if need be, which will be illustrated below.

  <h4 id="_localstorage_and_sessionstorage">localStorage and sessionStorage</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>With <tt>window.localStorage</tt> or <tt>window.sessionStorage</tt> (a.k.a. Web Storage) you can store any objects on the local disk as key-value pairs. Both objects implement <tt>Storage</tt> interface. The main difference between the two is that the lifespan of the former is longer. If the user reloads the page, the Web browser or restart the computer - the data saved with <tt>window.localStorage</tt> will survive while the data saved via <tt>window.sessionStorage</tt> won&#8217;t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Another distinction is that the data from <tt>window.localStorage</tt> is available for any page loaded from the same origin as the page that saved the data.  In case of <tt>window.sessionStorage</tt>, the data is available only to the window or a browser&#8217;s tab that saved it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Currently we use JavaScript API to work with Web Storage, but in the future any other programming language that can run in the browser will be able to work with the storage.  Saving the application state is the main use of the local storage. Coming back to a use case with the pharmaceutical salesman, in the offline mode you can save the name of the person she talked to in a particular medical office and the notes about the conversation that took place, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">localStorage.setItem('officeID', 123);
localStorage.setItem('contactPerson', 'Mary Lou');
localStorage.setItem('notes', 'Drop the samples of XYZin on 12/15/2013');</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Accordingly, to retrieve the saved information you&#8217;d need to use the method <tt>getItem()</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var officeID = localStorage.getItem('officeID');
var contact = localStorage.getItem('contactPerson');
var notes = localStorage.getItem('notes');</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This code sample are pretty simple as they store single values. In the real life scenarios we often need to store multiple objects. What it our salesperson has visited several medical offices and needs to save the information about all these visits in the Web Store?  For each visit we can create a key-value combination, where a <em>key</em> will include the unique id (e.g. office ID), and the <em>value</em> will be a JavaScript object (e.g. Visit) turned into a JSON-formatted string (see Chapter 4 for details) using <tt>JSON.stringify()</tt>.</p>

  <p>The Web storage API is pretty simple to use, but its major drawbacks are that it doesn&#8217;t give you a way to put any structure to your stored data, you always have to store strings, and the API is synchronous, which may case delays in the user interaction when your application is accessing the disk. In the next section you&#8217;ll learn about a more advanced way of storing data on the user&#8217;s computer.</p>

  <h4 id="_introduction_to_indexeddb">Introduction to IndexedDB</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">Indexed Database API</a> (a.k.a. IndexedDB) is a solution based on the NoSql database. The data is stored as key-value objects, and API offers a lot more advanced transactional handling of objects than with <tt>Storage</tt> interface. IndexedDB creates indexes of the stored objects for fast retrieval.
With Web Storage you can only store strings, and we had to do these tricks with JSON <tt>stingify()</tt> and <tt>parse()</tt> to give some structure to these strings. With IndexedDB you store and index regular JavaScript objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>IndexedDB allows you to accesses data asynchronously, so there won&#8217;t be UI freezes while accessing large objects on disk. You make a request to the database and define the event handlers that should process errors or result when ready. IndexedDB uses DOM events for all notifications. Success events don&#8217;t bubble, while error events do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The users will have a feeling that the application is pretty responsive, which wouldn&#8217;t be the case if you&#8217;ll be saving several megabytes of data with Web Storage API. Similarly to Web Storage, access to the IndexedDB databases is regulated by the <em>same origin policy</em>.</p>

  <p>Since not every browser supports IndexedDB yet, you can use Modernizr (see Chapter 3) to detect if your browsers supports it. If it does, you still may need to account for the fact that browser vendors name the IndexedDB related object differently. Hence to be on the safe side, at the top of your script include the statements to account for the prefixed vendor-specific implementations of <tt>indexedDB</tt> and related objects:</p>

      || window.msIndexedDB || window.webkitIndexedDB ;
if (!window.indexedDB){
   // this browser doesn't support IndexedDB
} else {
  medicalDB.IDBTransaction = window.IDBTransaction || window.webkitIDBTransaction;

  <p>In the above code snippet the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange"><tt>IDBKeyRange</tt></a> is an object that allows to restrict the range for the continuous keys while iterating through the objects. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBTransaction"><tt>IDBTransaction</tt></a> is an implementation of transaction support. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBCursor"><tt>IDBCursor</tt></a> is an object that represents a cursor for traversing over multiple objects in the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>IndexedDB doesn&#8217;t require you to describe a formal structure of your stored objects - any JavaScript object can be stored there.  Not having a formal definition of a database scheme is an advantage comparing to the relational databases where you can&#8217;t store the data until the structure of the tables is defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Your Web application can have one or more databases, and each of them can contain one or more <em>object stores</em>.  Each of the object stores will contain similar objects, e.g. one store is for salesman&#8217;s visits, while another has upcoming promotions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Every object that you are planning to store in the database has to have one property that plays a role similar to a primary key in a relational database. You have to decide if you want to maintain the value in this property manually, or use the the <tt>autoIncrement</tt> option where the values to this property will be assigned automatically. Coming back to our Visits example, you can either maintain the unique values of the <tt>officeId</tt> on your own or create a surrogate key that will be assigned by IndexedDB. The current generated number to be used as surrogate keys never decreases, and starts with the value of 1 in each object store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Similarly to relational databases you create indexes based on the searches that you run often. For example, if you need to search on the contact name in the Visits store, create an index on the property <tt>contactPerson</tt> of the <tt>Visit</tt> objects. But if in relational databases creation of indexes is done for performance reasons, with IndexedDB you can&#8217;t run a query unless the index on the relevant property exists. The following code sample shows how to connect to the existing or create a new object store <tt>Visits</tt> in a database called Medical_DB.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the world of traditional DBMS servers, when the database structure has to be modified, the DBA will do this upgrade, the server will be restarted, and the users will work with the <em>new version</em> of the database. With IndexedDB it works differently. Each database has a version, and when the new version of the database (e.g. Medical_DB) is created, the <tt>onupgradeneeded</tt> is dispatched, which is where object store(s) are created. But if you already had object stores in the older version of the database, and they don&#8217;t need to be changed - there is no need to re-create them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After successful connection to the database, the version number is available in <tt>IDBRequest.result.version</tt> property. The starting version of any database is 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The method <tt>open()</tt> takes a second parameter - the database version to be used. If you don&#8217;t specify the version - the latest one will be used. The following line shows how the application&#8217;s code can request connect to the version 3 of the database <tt>Medical_DB</tt>:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the user&#8217;s computer has already the <tt>Medical_DB</tt> database of one of the earlier versions (1 or 2), the <tt>onupgradeneeded</tt> handler will be invoked.  The initial creation of the database is triggered the same way - the absence of the database also falls under the "upgrade is needed" case, and the  <tt>onupgradeneeded</tt> handler has to invoke the <tt>createObjectStore()</tt> method. If upgrade is needed, the <tt>onupgradeneeded</tt> will be invoked before the <tt>onsuccess</tt> event.</p>

  <h5 id="_transactions">Transactions</h5>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Transaction is a logical unit of work. Executing several database operation in one transaction guarantees that the changes will be committed to the database only if all operations finished successfully. If at least one of the operations fails, the entire transaction will be rolled back (undone). IndexDB supports three transaction modes: <tt>readonly</tt>, <tt>readwrite</tt>, and <tt>versionchange</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To start any manipulations with the database you have to open a transaction in one of these modes. The <tt>readonly</tt> transaction (the  default one) allows multiple scripts to read from the database concurrently. This statement may raise a question - why would the user need a concurrent access to his local database is he&#8217;s the only user of the application on his device?  The reason being that the same application can be opened in more than one tab, or spawning more than one worker thread that need to access the local database. The <tt>readonly</tt> is the least restrictive mode and more than one script can open a <tt>readonly</tt> transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the application needs to modify or add objects to the database, open transaction in the <tt>readwrite</tt> mode - only one script can have it open on any particular object store. But you can have more than one <tt>readwrite</tt> transactions open at the same time on different stores. And if the database/store/index creation or upgrade has to be done, use the <tt>versionchange</tt> mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When a transaction is created, you should assign listeners to its <tt>complete</tt>, <tt>error</tt>, and <tt>abort</tt> events. If the <tt>complete</tt> event is fired, transaction is automatically commited - manual commits are not supported. If the <tt>error</tt> event is dispatched, the entire transaction is rolled back. Calling the method <tt>abort()</tt> will fire the <tt>abort</tt> event and will roll back transaction too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Here&#8217;s a sample scenario. Open the database and in the <tt>onsuccess</tt> handler create a transaction. Then open a transaction by calling the method <tt>objectStore()</tt> and perform data manipulations. In the next section you&#8217;ll see how to add objects to an object store using transactions.</p>

  <p>IndexedDB doesn&#8217;t support SQL. You&#8217;ll be using cursors to iterate through the object store. First, you open the transaction.

While opening the cursor you can specify optional parameters like the range of object keys you&#8217;d like to iterate and the direction of the cursor movement: <tt>IDBCursor.PREV</tt> or <tt>IDBCursor.NEXT</tt>. If none of the parameters is specified, the cursor will iterate all objects in the store in the ascending order. The following code snippet iterates through all Visit objects printing just contact names.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You can also create a cursor on indexes - this allows working with sorted sets of objects. In one of the earlier examples we&#8217;ve created an index on <tt>officeID</tt>. Now we can get a reference to this index and create a cursor on the specified range of sorted office IDs as in the following code snippet:</p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To limit the range of offices to iterate through, you could open the cursor on the <tt>officeIdIndex</tt> differently. Say you need to create a filter to iterate the offices with the numbers between 123 and 250. This is how you can open such a cursor:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>false</tt> in the third argument of <tt>bound()</tt> means that 123 should be included in the range, and the <tt>true</tt> in the fourth parameter excludes the object with <tt>officeID=250</tt> from the range.

  <p>This concludes our brief introduction to IndexedDB. Those of you who have experience in working with relational databases may find the querying capabilities of IndexedDB rather limited comparing to powerful relational databases like Oracle or MySQL. On the other hand, IndexedDB is pretty flexible - it allows you to store and look up any JavaScript objects without worrying about creating a database schema first. At the time of this writing there are no books dedicated to IndexedDB. For up to date information refer to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB">IndexedDB online documentation</a> at Mozilla Developer Network.</p>

  <h3 id="_history_api">History API</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To put is simple, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#the-history-interface">History API</a> is about ensuring that the Back/Forward  buttons on the browser toolbar can be controlled programmatically. Each Web browser has the <tt>window.history</tt> object. The History API is not a new HTML5 API,and the <tt>history</tt> object had such methods as <tt>back()</tt>, <tt>forward()</tt>, and <tt>go()</tt> for many years. But HTML5 adds new methods <tt>pushState()</tt> and <tt>replaceState()</tt>, which allow to modify the browser&#8217;s address bar without reloading the Web page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Imagine a Single Page Application (SPA) that has a navigational menu to open various views as based on the user&#8217;s interaction. Since these views represents some URLs loaded by making AJAX calls from your code, the Web browser still shows the original URL of the home page of your Web application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The perfect user would always navigate your application using the menus and controls you provided, but what if she clicks on the Back button of the Web browser?  If the navigation controls were not changing the URL in the browser&#8217;s address bar, the browser obediently will show the Web page that the user has visited before even launching your application, which is not what she intended to do.</p>

  <h4 id="_modifying_the_browser_s_history_with_pushstate">Modifying the Browser&#8217;s History with pushState()</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the URL of your application is <a href="http://myapp.com">http://myapp.com</a> and the user clicked on the menu item Get Customers, which made an AJAX call loading the cucustomers, you can programmatically change the URL on the browser&#8217;s address line to be <a href="http://myapp.com/customers">http://myapp.com/customers</a> without asking to Web browser to load anything from this URL. You do this by invoking the <tt>pushState()</tt> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The browser will just remember that the current URL is <a href="http://myapp.com/customers,">http://myapp.com/customers,</a> while the previous was <a href="http://myapp.com">http://myapp.com</a>. So pressing the Back button would change the address back to <a href="http://myapp.com,">http://myapp.com,</a> and not some unrelated Web application. The Forward button will also behave properly as per the history chain set by your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>pushState()</tt> takes three arguments:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

There is no resource that represents the URL that ends with <em>who_we_are</em> - it&#8217;s just the name of the view in the browser&#8217;s history.</p>

  <p>But changing the URL when the user clicks on the Back or Forward button is just the half of the job to be done. The content of the page has to be refreshed accordingly. The browser dispatches the event <tt>window.popstate</tt> whenever the browser&#8217;s navigation history changes either on initial page load, as a result of clicking on the Back/Forward buttons, or by invoking <tt>history.back()</tt> or <tt>history.forward()</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Your code has to include an event handler function that will  perform the actions that must be dome whenever the application gets into the state represented by the current suffix, e.g. make a server request to retrieve the data associated with the state <em>who_we_are</em>. The <tt>popstate</tt> event will contain a copy of the history&#8217;s entry state object.

  <p>In this chapter you&#8217;ve got introduced to a number of useful HTML5 APIs. You know how to check if a particular API is supported by your Web browser. But what if you are one of many enterprise developers that must use Internet Explorer of the versions earlier than 10.0? In this case <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">Google Chrome Frame</a> plugin for Internet Explorer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The users have to install Google Frame on their machines, and Web developers just need to add the following line to their Web pages:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After that the Web page rendering will be done by Chrome Frame while your Web application will run in Internet Explorer.</p>

  <div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The time has come to start working on our Web application Save Sick Child. It&#8217;s going to be a Web application that will supports donations to sick children, show some video, integrate the Google maps, and will feature an online auction. The goal is to gradually build all the functionality of the Web site while explaining each step of the way and giving you the reasons why we are building it the way we do. By the end of this chapter the Web design and the first prototype of the Save Sick Child will be ready.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The proliferation of mobile devices and Web applications require new skills for development of what was known as boring-looking enterprise applications. In the past, design of the user interface of most of the enterprise applications was done by developers to the best of their artistic abilities: a couple of buttons here, and a grid there on a gray background.  The business users were happy cause they did not see any better. The application allowed to process business data – what else to wish for?  Enterprise business users used to be happy with any UI as long as the application helped them to take care of their business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But today&#8217;s business users are spoiled by nice looking consumers applications, and more often than not new development starts with inviting a Web designer who should create a prototype of the future application.  For example, we’ve seen some excellent (from the UI perspective) functional specifications for boring financial applications made by professional designers.  Business users slowly but surely becoming more demanding in the area of the UI design solutions. The trend is clear: developer’s art does not cut it anymore.  You need to hire a professional Web designer for your next Web application. The software developers are not overly familiar with the tools that Web designers are using. This chapter will illustrate the process of design and prototyping of the UI of a Web application.</p>

  <p>Our Web designer, let&#8217;s call him Jerry, is ready to start working on the <em>mockup</em> (a.k.a. <em>wireframes</em>) - a set of images depicting various views of the future Save Sick Child application. We expect him to deliver images with comments that would briefly explain what should change in a view if a user will take  certain actions, e.g. clicks on the button. You can also think of a UI of an application as a set of states, and the user’s action result in your application transitioning from one state to the other. As nerds and mathematicians say, the UI of your application is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine">finite state machine</a>", which at any given point of time is in one of the finite number of states, for example, in the view state Donate Form or Auction.</p>

  <h3 id="_mobile_first">Mobile First?</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>While starting working on the design of a new Web application keep in mind that most likely some users will access it from mobile devices. Will the proposed UI look good on the mobile devices with smaller screens? Some people suggest using so-called "Mobile First" approach. For example, take the geographical location services. The users of iOS and Android devices are used to the fact that they can find the closest restaurant or a gas station based on their current location. Do you know that location feature can be available on the desktops too? Google maps API is just one of the services that can find the location of the user&#8217;s desktop based on its IP address, Wi-Fi router&#8217;s ID or proximity to the cell towers.Zeroing in on your device may not be as precise as with the smartphone&#8217;s GPS, but it may be good enough. So why not plan for adding this feature to all versions of your Web application?  Finding the closest charity event or a sick sick child can be done knowing an approximate location of your desktop computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s consider pointing devices. At the time of this writing, vast majority of the desktop users work with pixel-perfect mouse pointers or track pads. SmartPhone or tablet users work with fingers. One finger touch can cover a square with 100 pixels. The CNN site shows lots of news links located very close to each other on the screen. A finger may cover more than one link, and Android devices offer you a larger popup allowing you to select the link you really wanted to touch. Having the "Mobile first" state of mind doesn&#8217;t mean that CNN would need to keep the larger distance between the links for all the users. But this means that they should foresee the issues or innovate using the features offered by modern mobile devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In Chapter 11 we&#8217;ll discuss the <em>responsive design</em> techniques that allow to create the UI for Web applications that automatically re-allocate the screen content based on the screen size of the user&#8217;s device. Although this chapter is about the desktop version of the Sick Child Web application, its screen will consist of several rectangular areas that can be allocated differently (or even hidden) on smartphones or tablets.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock">

      <td class="content">
        
        Consider reading Chapter 11 now to understand what you will need to deal with to developing Web applications that look good on desktop monitors as well as on mobile screens. Understanding of the responsive design principles will help you in communications with your Web designer.

  <p>One of the constraints that the mobile users have is the relatively slow speed of the mobile Internet. This means that even though your desktop users will use fast LAN connection lines, your Web application has to be modularized and only the minimal number modules has to be loaded initially. Often mobile providers charge the user based on the amount of consumed data too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The chances are slim that the desktop users will lose the Internet connection for a long period of time. On the other hand, the mobile users may stay in the area with no or spotty connection. In this case the "Mobile First" thinking can lead to introducing an offline mode with limited functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Thinking upfront of the minimal content to be displayed on a small mobile screens may force you to change the design of the desktop Web pages too. In our sample Save Sick Child application we need to make sure that there is a space for the Donate button even on the smallest devices.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Visualize a project owner talking to Jerry in a cafeteria, and Jerry is drawing sketches of the future Web site on a napkin. Well, in the 21st Century he’ll use an electronic napkin so to speak - an excellent prototyping tool called <a href="http://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq Mockups</a>. This easy to use program gives you a working area where you create a mockup of your future Web application by dragging and dropping the required UI components from the toolbar onto the image of the Web page (see <a href="#FIG3-1">The working area of Balsamiq Mockups</a>).</p>

  <p>When the prototype is done, it can be saved as an image and sent to the project owner. Another option is to export the Balsamiq project into XML, and if both the project owner and Web designer have Balsamiq installed, they can work on the prototype in collaboration. For example, the designer exports the current states of the project, the owner imports it and makes corrections or comments, then exports it again and sends it back to the designer.</p>

  <h3 id="_the_project_owner_talks_to_a_web_designer">The Project Owner Talks to a Web Designer</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>During the first meeting Jerry talks to the project owner discussing the required functionality and then creates the UI to be implemented by Web developers. The artifacts produced by the designer vary depending on the qualifications of the designer. This can be a set of images representing different states of the UI with little <em>callouts</em> explaining the navigation of the application. If the Web designer is familiar with HTML and CSS, developers may get a working prototype in the form of HTML and CSS files, and this is exactly what Jerry will create by the end of this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Our project owner said to Jerry: <em>"The Save Sick Child Web site should allow people to make donations to sick children. The users should be able to find these children by specifying a geographical area on the map. The site should be integrated with a payment system, include a video player and display statistics about the donors and recipients. The site should include an online auction with proceeds going to charity. We&#8217;ll start working on the desktop version of this site first, but your future mockup should include three versions of the UI supporting desktops, tablets, and smartphones"</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After the meeting Jerry launched Balsamiq and started to work. He decided that the main window will consist of four areas laid out vertically:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p>The header with the logo and several navigation buttons</p>

    <li>
      <p>The main area with the Donate support plus the video player</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The area with the Find Local Kid, statistics, and charts.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The footer with several house-holding links plus the icons for Twitter and FaceBook.</p>

  <h3 id="_first_mockups">First Mockups</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The first deliverable of our Web designer (see <a href="#FIG3-2">The main view before clicking Donate Now</a> and <a href="#FIG3-3">The main view after clicking Donate Now</a>) depicted two states of the UI: before and after clicking the button Donate Now. The Web designer suggested that on the button click the Video Player would turn into a small button revealing the donation form.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG3-2" class="imageblock">

  <div class="title">Figure 34. The main view after clicking Donate Now</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The project owner suggested that turning the video into a Donate button may not be a the best idea. We shouldn’t forget that the main goal of this application is collecting donation, so they decided to keep the user&#8217;s attention on the Donate area and move the video player to the lower portion of the window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After that they went over the mockups of the authorization routine. The view states in this process can be :
1. Not Logged On
2. The Login Form
3. Wrong ID/Password
4. Forgot Password
5. Successfully Logged On</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Web designer has created mockups of some of these states as shown on  <a href="#FIG3-4">The user haven&#8217;t clicked on the Login button</a> and <a href="#FIG3-5">The user haven&#8217;t clicked on the Login button</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The latter shows different UI states should the user decide to log in. The project owner reviewed the mokups and return them back to Jerry with some comments. The project owner wanted to make sure that the user doesn&#8217;t have to log on to the application to access the Web site. The process of making donations has to be as easy as possible, and forcing the donor to log on may scare some people away, so the project owner left his comment as shown on <a href="#FIG3-5">The user haven&#8217;t clicked on the Login button</a>.</p>

        Authors of this book assume that the users of our Save Sick Child site work with the modern versions of Web browsers (two year old or younger). The real world Web developers need to deal with finding workarounds to the unsupported CSS or HTML5 features in the old browsers, but modern IDE generate HTML5 boilerplate code that include large CSS files providing different solutions to older browsers. JavaScript frameworks implement workaround for features unsupported by old browsers too, so we don&#8217;t want to clutter the text providing several versions of the code just to make book samples work in outdated browsers.

  <p>This chapter will include lots of code samples illustrating how the UI is gradually being built.

  <p>In this section you&#8217;ll see several Aptana projects that show how the static mockup will turn into a working prototype with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Jerry, the designer, decided to have four separate areas on the page hence he created the HTML file index.html that has the tag <tt>&lt;header&gt;</tt> with the navigation tag <tt>&lt;nav&gt;</tt>, two <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt> tags for the middle sections of the page and a <tt>&lt;footer&gt;</tt>:</p>

But looking at the login-related <tt>&lt;a&gt;</tt> tags in the code above you&#8217;ll find nothing but <tt>href="javascript:void(0)"</tt>. So why the button reacts? Read the code in the main.js shown below, and you&#8217;ll find there line <tt>loginLink.addEventListener('click', showLoginForm, false);</tt> that invokes the callback <tt>showLoginForm()</tt>. That why the Login button reacts. This seems confusing cause the anchor component was used here just for styling purposes. In this example a better solution  would be to replace the anchor tag <tt>&lt;a id="login-link" class="show-form" href="javascript:void(0)"&gt;</tt> with another component that doesn&#8217;t make the code confusing, for example <tt>&lt;div id="login-link" class="show-form"&gt;</tt>.</p>

        A Single Page Web Applications (SPA) is an architectural approach that doesn&#8217;t require the user going through multiple pages to navigate the site. The user enters the URL in the browser, which brings the Web page that remains open on the screen until the user stop working with this application. The portion of the user&#8217;s screen may change as the user navigate the application, the new data comes in using the AJAX techniques (see Chapter 4), or the new DOM elements will need to be created during the runtime, but the main page itself doesn&#8217;t gets reloaded. This allows building so-called fat client applications that can remember its state. Besides, most likely your HTML5 application will use some JavaScript framework, which in SPA gets loaded only once when the home page gets created by the browser.

  <p>Now let&#8217;s examine the JavaScript code located in main.js. This code will self-invoke the anonymous function, which creates an object - encapsulated namespace ssc (short for Save Sick Child). This avoids polluting the global namespace. If we wanted to expose anything from this closure to the global namespace we could have done is as described in Chapter 1 in the section Closures, but in our example the code in main.js is completely sealed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the beginning of Chapter 1 we&#8217;ve recommended to put the <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> tag with your JavaScript at the end of your HTML file, which we did in our index.html above. If you move the line <tt>&lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</tt> to the top of the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> section and re-run index.html the screen will look as in <a href="#FIG3-7">Working prototype. Take2: Login.</a>, but clicking on the Login won&#8217;t display the login form as it should. Why? Because registering of the event listeners in the script main.js failed cause the DOM components  (<tt>login-link</tt>, <tt>login-form</tt> and others) were not created yet by the time this script was running. Open the Firebug or other debugging tool and you&#8217;ll see an error on the console that will look similar to the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><em>"TypeError: loginLink is null
loginLink.addEventListener(<em>click</em>, showLoginForm, false);"</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Of course, in many cases your JavaScript code could have tested if the DOM elements exist before using them, but in this particular sample it&#8217;s just easier to to put the script at the end of the HTML file. Another solution would be to load the JavaScript code located in main.js in a separate handler function that would run only when the window&#8217;s <tt>load</tt> event is dispatched by the browser indicated that the DOM is ready: <tt>window.onload = function() {...}</tt>. You&#8217;ll see how to do this in the next version of main.js.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After reviewing the HTML and JavaScript code let&#8217;s spend a little more time with the CSS that supports the pages shown in <a href="#FIG3-7">Working prototype. Take2: Login.</a>. The difference between the screen shots shown in <a href="#FIG3-6">Working prototype. Take 1: Getting Started.</a> and <a href="#FIG3-7">Working prototype. Take2: Login.</a> is substantial. First, the top left image is nowere to be found in index.html. Open the styles.css file and you&#8217;ll see the line <tt>background: url(../img/logo.png) no-repeat;</tt> in the <tt>header h1#logo</tt> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The page layout is also specified in the file styles.css. In this version the sizes of each section is specified in pixels (px), which won&#8217;t make you page fluid and easily resizable.  For example, the HTML element with <tt>id="main-top-section"</tt> is styled like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="css">#main-top-section {
	width: 100%;
	height: 320px;
	margin-top: 18px;
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Jerry styled the main to section to take the entire width of the browser&#8217;s window and to be 320 pixels tall. If you&#8217;ll keep in mind the "Mobile First" mantra, this may not be the best approach cause 320 pixels mean difference size (in inches) on the displays with different screen density. For example, 320 pixels on the iPhone 5 with retina display will look a lot smaller than 320 pixels on the iPhone 4. You may consider switching from <tt>px</tt> to <tt>em</tt> units: 1em is equal to the current font height, 2em means twice the size et al. You can read more about creating scalable style sheets with <em>em</em> units at <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/css2em.htm">http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/css2em.htm</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>What looks a Login button on <a href="#FIG3-7">Working prototype. Take2: Login.</a> is not a button, but a styled <tt>div</tt> element. Initially it was a clickable anchor <tt>&lt;a&gt;</tt>, and we&#8217;ve explained this change right after the listing shown index.html above. The CSS fragment supporting the Login button looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">li#login input {
	width: 122px;
	padding: 4px;
	border: 1px solid #ddd;
	border-radius: 2px;
	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>border-radius</tt> element makes the corners rounded of the HTML element it applied to.  But why we repeat it three times with additional prefixes <tt>-moz-</tt> and <tt>-webkit-</tt>? These are so called <em>CSS vendor prefixes</em>, which allow the Web browser vendors to implement experimental CSS properties that haven&#8217;t been standardized yet. For example, <tt>-webkit-</tt> is the prefix for all WebKit-based browsers: Chrome, Safari, Android, iOS. Microsoft uses <tt>-ms-</tt> for Internet Explorer, Opera uses <tt>-o-</tt>.  These prefixes are temporary measures, which make the CSS files heavier than they need to be. The time will come when the CSS3 standard properties will be implemented by all browser vendors and you won&#8217;t need to use these prefixes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>As a matter of fact, unless yo uwant this code to work in the very old versions of Firefox, you can remove the line <tt>-moz-border-radius: 2px;</tt> from our styles.css because Mozilla has implemented the property <tt>border-radius</tt> in most of their browser . You can find a list of CSS properties with the corresponding vendor prefixes in <a href="http://peter.sh/experiments/vendor-prefixed-css-property-overview/">this list</a> maintained by Peter Beverloo.</p>

The raster graphics can give you these boxy pixelated images if the size of the image needs to be increased. We use the vector images for our footer section that are treated as fonts. They will look as good as originals on any screen size, besides you can change their properties (e.g. color) as easy as you&#8217;d do with any other font.  The images that you see on <a href="#FIG3-9">The footer section</a> are are located in the fonts directory of the project-03-footer.

  <p>Let&#8217;s run the Aptana&#8217;s project called project-05-html5-video to see it working, and after that we&#8217;ll review the code. The new version of the Sick Save Child should look as in &lt;&lt;FIG3-12&gt;. The users will see an embedded video player on the right that can play the video located in the assets/media folder of the Aptana&#8217;s project project-05-html5-video.</p>

  <div class="title">Figure 43. The video player is embeded</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s see how our index.html has changed since its previous version. The bottom part of the main section includes the <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt> tag. In the past, the videos in Web pages were played predominantly by the browser&#8217;s Flash Player plugin (even older popular plugins included RealPlayer, MediaPlayer, and QuickTime). For example, you could have used the HTML tag `&lt;embed src="myvideo.swf" height="300" width="300"&gt;`and if the user&#8217;s browser supports Flash Player, that&#8217;s all you needed for basic video play. While there were plenty of open source video players, creation of the enterprise-grade video player for Flash videos became an important skill for some software developers. For example, HBO, an American cable network offers an advanced multi-featured video player embedded into <a href="http://www.hbogo.com">www.hbogo.com</a> for their subscribers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In today&#8217;s world most of the modern mobile Web browsers don&#8217;t support Flash Player, and the video content providers prefer broadcasting videos in formats that are supported by all the browsers and can be embedded into Web page using the standard HTML5 element <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt> (see its current working draft is published at <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-video-element.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-video-element.html</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The following code fragment illustrates how we&#8217;ve embedded the video into the bottom portion of our Web page (index.html). It includes two <tt>&lt;source&gt;</tt> elements, which allows to provide alternative media resources. If the Web browser supports playing video specified in the first <tt>&lt;source&gt;</tt> element, it&#8217;ll ignore the other versions of the media. For example, the code below offers two versions of the video file: intro.mp4 (in H.264/MPEG-4 format natively supported by Safari and Internet Explorer) and intro.webm (WebM format for Firefox, Chrome, and Opera).</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;section id="main-bottom-section"&gt;
 &lt;div id="video-container"&gt;
 	&lt;video controls poster="assets/media/intro.jpg"
 	       width="390px" height="240" preload="metadata"&gt;

 		&lt;source src="assets/media/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
 		&lt;source src="assets/media/intro.webm" type="video/webm"&gt;
 		&lt;p&gt;Sorry, your browser doesn't support video&lt;/p&gt;
 	&lt;/video&gt;

 		&lt;h3&gt;Video header goes here&lt;/h3&gt;
 		&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;More videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The boolean property <tt>controls</tt> asks the Web browser to display the video player with controls (the play/pause buttons, the full screen mode, et al.) If you wouldn&#8217;t use the property <tt>controls</tt> your JavaScript could would have to control the playback. The <tt>poster</tt> property of the <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt> tag specifies the image to display as a placeholder for the video - this is the image you see on <a href="#FIG3-12">The video player is embeded</a>. In our case the <tt>preload</tt> valus is <tt>metadata</tt>, which means that we want the Web browser to preload just the first frame of the video its metadata. Should we used <tt>preload="auto"</tt>, the video would start loading in the background as soon as the Web page was loaded unless the user&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t allow it (e.g. Safari on iOS) for saving the bandwidth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>All major Web browsers released in 2011 and later include their own embedded video players that support the <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt> element. It&#8217;s great that your code doesn&#8217;t depend on the support of the Flash Player, but now video players look different depending on which browser the user has.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If neither .mp4 nor .webm files can be played, the content in the <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>  tag displays the fallback message "Sorry, your browser doesn&#8217;t support video". If you need to support older Web browsers that don&#8217;t support HTML5 video, but support Flash Player, you can replace this <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> tag with the <tt>&lt;object&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;embed&gt;</tt> tags that embed another media file that Flash Player understands. Finally, if you believe that some users may have the browsers that support neither the <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt> tag nor Flash Player, just add the links to the files listed in the <tt>&lt;source&gt;</tt> tags right after the closing <tt>&lt;/video&gt;</tt> tag.</p>

  <p>Another way to include videos in your Web application is by uploading them to YouTube first and then embedding if into your Web page. This provides a number of benefits:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

    <li>
      <p>The users can either watch the video as a part of your application&#8217;s Web page or, by clicking on the YouTube logo on the status bar of the video player you can continue watching the video from its original YouTube URL.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>YouTube is streaming videos in the compressed form and the user can watch it as the bytes come in - it doesn&#8217;t require a video to be fully preloaded to the user&#8217;s device.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>YouTube stores videos in several formats and automatically selects the best one based on the user&#8217;s Web browser (user agent).</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The HTML code to embed a YouTube video is generated for you by pressing the Share and then Embed link by the video itself.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>You can enrich your Web application by incorporating extensive video libraries by using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/">YouTube Data API</a>. You can create fine tuned searches retrieving channels, playlists, videos, manage subscriptions, and authorize user requests.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Your users can save the YouTube videos on their local drive using free Web Browsers add-ons like DownloadHelper extension for Firefox or a RealDownloader.</p>

  <p>Open the file index.html in the Aptana&#8217;s project-06-YouTube-video and you&#8217;ll see there a code that replaces the <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt> tag of the previous project. It should look like this:</p>

  <p>Does your old desktop computer have a GPS hardware? Most likely it doesn&#8217;t. But its location can be calculated with varying degree of accuracy. If your desktop computer is connected to the network it has an IP address or your local Wi-Fi router may have an SSID given by the router vendor or your Internet provider so the location of your desktop computer is not a secret, unless you change the SSID of your Wi-Fi router. Highly populated areas have more Wi-Fi routers and cell towers so the accuracy increases.

  <p>Knowing the device coordinates is very important, but let&#8217;s make the location information more presentable by feeding the device coordinates to <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a>.

This is a must have feature detection library that helps your application to figure out if the user&#8217;s browser supports certain HTML5/CSS3 features. Review the code of index.html from the Aptana&#8217;s project-08-1-modernizr-geolocation-maps. Note that the index.html includes two <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> sections - the Modernizr&#8217;s JavaScript gets loaded first, while our own main.js is loaded at the end of the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> section.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Modernizr is an open source JavaScript library that helps your script to figure out if the required HTML or CSS features are supported by the user&#8217;s browser. Instead of maintaining complex cross-browser feature matrix to see if, say <tt>border-radius</tt> is supported in the user&#8217;s version of Firefox, the Modernizer queries the <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> elements to see what&#8217;s supported and what&#8217;s not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Note the following fragment on the top of index.html: <tt>&lt;html class="no-js" lang="en"&gt;</tt>.  For Modernizr to work, your HTML root element has to include the class named <tt>"no-js"</tt>. On page load, the Modernizr will replace the <tt>no-js</tt> class with its extended version that lists all detected features, and those that are not supported will get a prefix <tt>no-</tt>. Run index.html from project-08-1-modernizr-geolocation-maps in Firefox and you&#8217;ll see in Firebug that the values of the <tt>class</tt> property of the <tt>html</tt> element are different now, and you can see from <a href="#FIG3-17">Modernizr changed the HTML&#8217;s class property</a>  that our version of Firefox doesn&#8217;t support touch events (<tt>no-touch</tt>), flexbox (<tt>no-flexbox</tt>), et al.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 48. Modernizr changed the HTML&#8217;s class property</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For example, there is a new way to do page layouts using co called CSS Flexible Box Layout Module. This feature is not widely supported yet, and as you can see from <a href="#FIG3-17">Modernizr changed the HTML&#8217;s class property</a>, our Web browser doesn&#8217;t support it at the time of this writing. If the CSS file of your application will implement two class selectors <tt>.flexbox</tt> and <tt>.no-flexbox</tt> then the browsers that support flexible boxes will use the former and the older browsers - the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When Modernizr loads it creates a new JavaScript object <tt>window.Modernizr</tt> with lots of boolean properties indicating if a certain feature is or is not supported (see <a href="#FIG3-18">window.Modernizr object</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG3-18" class="imageblock">

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Hence your JavaScript code can test if certain features are supported or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>What if the Modernizer detects that a certain feature is not supported yet by a user&#8217;s older browser? You can include polyfills in your code that replicate the required functionality. You can write such a polyfill on your own or pick one from the collection that is located at <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills">Modernizr&#8217;s Github repository</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now let&#8217;s consider the "nope" case. The code of the get-geo-data-by-ip.js has to offer an alternative way of getting the location for the browsers that don&#8217;t support HTML5 Geolocation API. We found the GeoIP JavaScript API offered by <a href="http://www.maxmind.com/">MaxMind, Inc.</a>. Their service returns country, region, city, latitude and longitude, which can serve as a good illustration of how a workaround of a non-supported feature can be implemented. The code in get-geo-data-by-ip.js is very simple for now.</p>

  <p>Most likely your browser supports HTML5 geolocation API, and you&#8217;ll see the map created by the script get-native-geo-data.js.

This is more generic way of loading any APIs comparing to loading maps from <a href="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api">http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api</a> in the previous section on integrating geolocation and maps.

  <p>Jerry has yet another cool idea: show multiple markers on the map reflecting several donation campaigns and charity events that are going on at various locations. If we display  this information on the Save Sick Child page more people may participate with their donations or other ways. We&#8217;ve just learned how to do an address search on the map, and if the application has an access to the data about charity events, we can display them as the markers on the map. Run the project-10-maps-multi-markers and you&#8217;ll see a map with multiple markers as in <a href="#FIG3-20">Multiple markers on the map</a></p>

  <p>The JavaScript fragment below displays the map with multiple markers. In this example the data is hard-coded in the array <tt>charityEvents</tt>, but in the next chapter we&#8217;ll modify this example and will get the data from a file in a JSON form. The for-loop creates a marker for each of the event listed in the array <tt>charityEvents</tt>. Each element of this array is also an array containing the name of the city and state, the latitude and longitude, and the title of the charity event. You can have any other attributes of the charity events stored in such an array and display them when the user clicks on a particular marker in an overlay by calling <tt>InfoWindow.open()</tt>.</p>

  <h3 id="_summary_4">Summary</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This chapter has described the process of mocking the future Web site on by our Web Designer Jerry, who went a lot further than creating a number of images with short descriptions. Jerry created a working prototype of the Save Sick Child page. Keep in mind that Jerry and his fellow Web designers like to create beautiful Web pages. But us, Web developers need to worry about other things like making Web pages responsive and light weight. The first thing you need to do after receiving the prototype of your Web application from Jerry is run it through Google Developer Tools or Firebug and measure the total size of the resources being downloaded from the server. If it loads 1Mb or more worth of images, ask Jerry to review the resources and minimize the size. If the first page makes 100 calls to the server just to download all required resources - ask Jerry to group them.  But optimizing the main (or the only) page of your application is not only Jerry&#8217;s task. The chances are that you don&#8217;t need to download all the JavaScript code at once - we&#8217;ll discuss modularization of large applications in Chapter 7.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The next phase of improving this prototype is to remove the hard-coded data from the code and place them into external files. The next chapter will cover the JSON data format and how to fill our single-page application with the data using a set of techniques called AJAX.</p>
</div>

  <div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This chapter is about bringing the external data to HTML Web pages. In the previous chapters we&#8217;ve been using only hard-coded data - our goal was to see how to layout the Web page and how to change the layout in case some events have happened, e.g. the user clicked on the menu button. Now we&#8217;ll make sure that our single-page application Save Sick Child can request the data from the external sources and send them the data too. This comes down to two questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p>How an HTML Web page can exchange the data with external data sources?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>What format to use for presenting the application data?</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>While there could be different answers to these questions, we&#8217;ll be using AJAX techniques as an answer to the first question and JSON data format as an answer to the second one. We&#8217;ll start this chapter with explaining why AJAX and JSON are appropriate choice for the Save Sick Child Web application and many others.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_why_ajax">Why AJAX</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If a user points her Web browser to one URL and then changes it to another, the new request will be sent to the new URL, and the new page will arrive and will be rendered by the browser. The URL may have been changed not because the user decided to go to visit a different Web site, but simply because the user selected a menu item that resulted in bringing a new Web page from the same domain. This was pretty much the only way Web sites were designed in the 90th.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Back in 1999, Microsoft decided to create a Web version of Outlook - their popular eMail application. Their goal was to be able to modify the Input folder as the new emails arrive, but without refreshing the entire content of the Web page. They created an ActiveX control called <tt>XMLHTTP</tt> that lived inside Internet Explorer 5 and could make requests to the remote servers receiving data without the need to refresh the entire Web page. Such a Web Outlook client would would make periodic requests to the mail server, and if the new mail arrived the application would insert the new row on the top of the Inbox by direct change of the DOM object from JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In early 2000th, other Web browsers adopted this model and implemented their own versions of <tt>XMLHTTPRequest</tt>. Its Working Draft 6 is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">published by W3C</a>.  Google created their famous email client GMail and Map Web applications.  In 2005 Jesse James Garrett wrote an article titled "AJAX: A New Approach to Web Applications". The Web developer community liked the term AJAX, which stand for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, and this gave a birth to the new breed of Web applications that could update the content of just the portion of a Web page without re-retrieving the entire page. Interestingly enough, the last letter in the AJAX acronym stands for XML, while realistically presenting the data in the XML form is not required, and is seldom used as a data format in the client-server exchanges. JSON is used a lot more often to represent the data, but apparently AJAJ didn&#8217;t sound as good as AJAX.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Visit the <a href="http://www.google.com/finance">Google Finance</a> or <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Finance</a> Web pages when the stock market is open, and you&#8217;ll see how the price quotes or other financial indicators are changing while the most of the content remains the same. This gives an illusion of the server pushing the data to your Web client. But most likely, it not a data push but rather periodic <em>polling</em> of the server&#8217;s data using AJAX. In the modern Web applications we expect to see more of the real server side data push using HTML5 WebSockets API, which is described in details in Chapter 9 of this book.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_why_json">Why JSON</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a href="http://www.json.org/js.html">JSON</a> stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It&#8217;s a more compact than XML way to represent the data. Besides, all modern Web Browsers understand and can parse JSON data. After learning the JavaScript object literals in Chapter 1, you&#8217;ll see that the presenting the data in JSON notation is almost the same as writing JavaScript object literals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a href="#FIG4-1">Anatomy of a Web application</a> depicts a high level view of a typical Web application. All of the code samples from Chapter 1 and Chapter 3 were where written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS. in this chapter will add to the mix the <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> object that will send and receive the JSON content wrapped into <tt>HTTPRequest</tt> and <tt>HTTPResponse</tt> objects.</p>

  <div class="title">Figure 52. Anatomy of a Web application</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Back in the 90th, if a Web application would need some JavaScript code or data from the server, Web developers would wrap it into an HTML <tt>&lt;iFrame&gt;</tt> element and send it to the client, which would use the the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval"><tt>eval()</tt></a> function to execute it. Today, there is no need to do this if you just want to send the data - format it as a JSON object and use the JSON parser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When a Web page is loaded the user doesn&#8217;t know (and doesn&#8217;t have to know) that the page content was brought from several servers that can be located thousands miles apart. More often than not, when the user enters the URL requesting an HTML document, the server side code can engage several servers to bring all the data requested by the user. Some of the data are retrieved by making calls to one or more Web Services. The legacy Web services were build using SOAP + XML, but  majority of today&#8217;s Web services are build using lighter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"><em>RESTful architecture</em></a>, and JSON has become a de facto standard data exchange format of the REST Web services.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_how_ajax_works">How AJAX Works</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Imagine a single-page application that needs some data to refreshed in real time. For example, our Save Sick Child application includes an online auction where people can bid and purchase some goods as a part of a charity event. If John from New York placed a bid on certain auction item, and some time later Mary from Chicago placed the higher bid on the same item, we want to make sure that John knows about it immediately, in real time.  This means that the server-side software that received Mary&#8217;s bid has to push this data to all users who expressed their interest in the same item.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But the server has to send and the browser has to modify only the new price while the rest of the content of the Web page should remain the same. You can implement behavior using AJAX. But first, the bad news:
you can&#8217;t implement the real-time server side push with AJAX. You can only emulate this behavior by using polling techniques, when the <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> object sits inside your JavaScript code and periodically sends HTTP requests to the server asking if there were any changes in bids since the last request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If, for instance, the last request was made at 10:20:00AM, the new bid was placed at 10:20:02AM, and the application makes a new request (and updates the browser&#8217;s window) at 10:20:25AM, this means that the user will be notified about the price change with a three second delay. AJAX is still request-response based way of getting the server&#8217;s data, and strictly speaking, doesn&#8217;t offer a real real-time updates. Some people use the term <em>near real time</em> notifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Another bad news is that AJAX uses HTTP protocol for the data communication, which means that a substantial overhead in the form of <tt>HTTPResponse</tt> header will be added to the new price, and it can be as large as several hundred bytes. This is still better than sending the entire page to the Web browser, but HTTP adds a hefty overhead.</p>

        We&#8217;ll implement such an auction in Chapter 9 using a lot more efficient protocol called WebSockets, which supports a real-time data push and adds only several extra bytes to the data load.

  <h4 id="_retrieving_data_from_the_server">Retrieving Data From the Server</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s try to implement AJAX techniques by implementing a data retrieval. The process of making an AJAX request is well defined and consists of the following steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Create an instance of XMLHttpRequest object.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Initialize the request to your data source by invoking the method <tt>open()</tt>.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Assign the a handler to the <tt>onreadystatechange</tt> attribute to process server&#8217;s response.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Make a request to the data source by calling <tt>send()</tt>.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>In your handler function process the response when it arrives from the server.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Modify the DOM elements based on the received data, if need be.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In most of the books on AJAX you&#8217;ll see browser-specific ways of instantiating the <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> object (a.k.a. XHR). Most likely you&#8217;ll be developing your application using some JavaScript framework and all browser specifics in instantiating of the <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> will be hidden from you. Chapters 6 and 7 include such examples, but let&#8217;s stick to the standard JavaScript way implemented by all modern browsers:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><tt>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The next step is to initialize a request by invoking the method <tt>open()</tt>. You need to provide the HTTP method (<tt>GET</tt>, <tt>POST</tt> et al.), the URL of the data source. Optionally, you can provide three more arguments: a Boolean variable indicating if you want this request to be processed asynchronously (which is the default), and the user id and password if the authentication is required. Keep in mind, that the following method does not request the data yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><tt>xhr.open('GET', dataUrl);</tt></p>

<div class="admonitionblock">

  <p>XHR has an attribute <tt>readyState</tt>, and as soon as it changes the callback function assigned to the <tt>onreadystatechange</tt> will be invoked. This callback should contain your application specific code to analyze the response and process it accordingly. Assigning such a callback is pretty simple:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><tt>xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){...}</tt></p>

  <p>Finally, send the AJAX request for data. The method <tt>send()</tt> can be called with or without parameters depending on if you need to send the data to the server or not. In its simplest fore the method <tt>send()</tt> can be invoked as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>` xhr.send();`</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s spend a bit more time discussing the completion of the this cycle when server&#8217;s response is received and the XHR&#8217;s <tt>readyState</tt> is equal to 4. This means that we&#8217;ve got something back, which can be either the data we&#8217;ve expected or the error message. We need to handle both scenarios in the function assigned to the <tt>onreadystatechange</tt> attribute. This is a common way to do it in JavaScript without using frameworks:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){

 if (xhr.readyState == 4) {

   if((xhr.status &gt;=200 &amp;&amp; xhr.status &lt;300) || xhr.status===304) {

       // We got the data. Get the value from one of the response attributes
       // e.g. xhr.responseText and process the data accordingly.

   } else {
      // We got an error. Process the error code and
      // display the content of the statusText attribute.
   }

  }
};</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>First the code should check the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">HTTP status code</a> received from server. W3C splits the HTTP codes into groups. The codes numbered as 1xx are informational, 2xx are successful codes, 3xx are about redirections, 4xx represent bad requests (like infamous 404 for Not Found), and 5xx for server errors. That&#8217;s why the above code fragment checks for all 2xx codes and 304 - the data was not modified and taken from cache.</p>

  <h4 id="_ajax_good_and_bad">AJAX: Good and Bad</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>AJAX techniques have their pros and cons. You saw how easy it was to create a Web page that didn&#8217;t have to refresh itself, but provided the users with the means of communicating with the server. This certainly improves the user experience. The fact that AJAX allows you to lower the amount of data that goes over the wire is important too. Another important advantage of AJAX that it works in a standard HTML/JavaScript environment and is supported by all Web browsers. The JavaScript frameworks hides all the differences in instantiating <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> and simplify making HTTP requests and processing responses. Since the entire page is not reloaded, you can create "fat clients" that keep certain data preloaded once and reused in your JavaScript in different use cases. With AJAX you can lazy load some content as needed rather than loading everything at once. Taken for granted auto-completion feature would not be possible in HTML/JavaScript application without the AJAX.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>On the bad side, with AJAX the user loses the functionality of the browser&#8217;s Back button, which reloads the previous Web page while the user could expect to see the previous state of the same page. Since the AJAX brings most of the content dynamically, the search engines wouldn&#8217;t rank your Web pages as high as it would do if the content was statically embedded in the HTML. Increasing the amount of AJAX interactions means that your application will have to send more of the JavaScript code to the Web browser, which increases the complexity of programming and decreases the scalability of your application.</p>

        The above code has an issue, which may not be so obvious, but can irritate users. The problem is that it doesn&#8217;t handle errors. Yes, we print the error message on the developer&#8217;s console, but the end user will never see them. If for some reason the data about countries or states won&#8217;t arrive, the dropdowns will be empty, the donation form won&#8217;t be valid and the users will become angry that they can&#8217;t make a donation without knowing why. Proper error handling and reports are very important for any application so never ignore it. You should display a user-friendly error messages on the Web page.

  <h3 id="_using_json">Using JSON</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In any client-server application one of the important decisions to be made is about the format of the data that go over the network. We are talking about the application-specific data. Someone has to decide how to represent the data about an Auction Item, Customer, Donation et al. The easiest way to represent text data is Comma Separated Format (CSV), but it&#8217;s not easily readable by humans, hard to validate,  and recreation of JavaScript objects from CSV feed would require additional information about the headers of the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Sending the data in XML form addresses the readability and validation issues, but it&#8217;s very verbose. Every data element has to be surrounded by an opening and closing tag describing the data. Converting the XML data to/from JavaScript object requires special parsers, and you&#8217;d need to use one of the JavaScript libraries for cross-browser compatibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In today&#8217;s Web, JSON became the most popular data format. It&#8217;s not as verbose as XML, and JSON&#8217;s notation is almost the same as JavaScript object literals. It&#8217;s easily readable by humans, and every ECMAScript 5 compliant browser includes a native JSON object: <tt>window.JSON</tt>. Even though the JSON formatted data look like JavaScript object literals, JSON is language independent. Here&#8217;s an example of the data in the JSON format:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">{
 "fname":"Alex",
 "lname":"Smith",
 "age":30,
 "address": {
     "street":"123 Main St.",
     "city": "New York"}
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Anyone who knows JavaScript understands that this is an object that represents a person, which has a nested object that represents an address. Note the difference with JavaScript literals: the names of the properties are always strings, and every string must be taken into quotes. Representing the same object in XML would need a lot more characters (e.g. <tt>&lt;fname&gt;Alex&lt;/fname&gt;</tt> etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There are some other important differences between JSON and XML. The structure of the XML document can be defined using DTD or XML Schema, which simplifies the data validation, but requires additional programming and schema maintenance. On the other hand, JSON data have data types, for example the age attribute in the above example is not only a <tt>Number</tt>, but will be further evaluated by the JavaScript engine and will be stored as an integer. JSON also supports arrays while XML doesn&#8217;t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For parsing JSON in JavaScript you use the method <tt>JSON.parse()</tt>, which takes a string and returns JavaScript object, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var customer=JSON.parse('{"fname":"Alex","lname":"Smith"}');

console.log(“Your name is ” + customer.fname + “ “ + customer.lname);
</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For a reverse operation - turning an object into JSON string - do <tt>JSON.stringify(custormer)</tt>. The older browsers didn&#8217;t have the <tt>JSON</tt> object, and there is an alternative way of parsing JSON is with the help of the script json2.js, which creates the JSON property on the global object. The json2.js is freely available on <a href="http://bit.ly/aUMLnL">Github</a>. In Chapter 3 you&#8217;ve learned about feature detection with Modernizr, and you can automate the loading of this script if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">Modernizr.load({
    test: window.JSON,
    nope: 'json2.js',
    complete: function () {
        var customer = JSON.parse('{"fname":"Alex","lname":"Smith"}');
    }
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Usually, JSON-related articles and blogs are quick to remind you about the evil nature of the JavaScript function <tt>eval()</tt> that can take an arbitrary JavaScript code and execute it. The <tt>JSON.parse()</tt> is pictured as a protection against the malicious JavaScript that can be injected into your application&#8217;s code and then executed by <tt>eval()</tt> by the Web browser. The main argument is that <tt>JSON.parse()</tt> will not be processing the incoming code unless it contains valid JSON data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Protecting your application code from being infected by means of <tt>eval()</tt> can be done outside of your application code. Replacing HTTP with secure HTTPS protocol helps a lot in this regard. Some Web applications  eliminate the possibility of cross-origin scripting by routing all requests to third-party data sources via proxying such requests through your trusted servers. But proxying all requests through your server may present scalability issues - imagine if thousands of concurrent users will be routed through your server - so do some serious load testing before making this architectural decision.</p>

        There are several JSON tools useful for developers. To make sure that your JSON data is valid and properly formatted use using <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a>. If you paste an ugly one-line JSON data JSLint will reformat it into a readable form. There is also an add-on JSONView, available both for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview/">Firefox</a> and for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc">Chrome</a> browsers.  With JSONView the JSON objects are displayed in a pretty formatted collapsible format. If there are errors in the JSON document they will be reported. At the time of this writing Chrome&#8217;s version of JSONView does a better job in  reporting errors.

  <h3 id="_json_in_java">JSON in Java</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If a Web browser receives JSON stream from the server the application needs to turn it into JavaScript objects. If a Web client needs to send the JavaScriot objects to the server they can be converted into JSON string. Similar tasks have to be performed on the server side. Our Save Sick Child application uses Java application server. There is a number of third-party Java libraries that can consume and generate JSON content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There are several Java libraries to convert Java objects into their JSON representation and back, for example <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/">Google’s Gson</a>, <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/">Jackson</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/">json-simple</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Google&#8217;s Gson is probably the simplest one for use. It provides methods <tt>toJson()</tt> and <tt>fromJson()</tt> to convert Java objects to JSON and back. Gson allows pre-existing un-modifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON and Supports Java Generics. Gson works well with complex objects with deep inheritance hierarchies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s say JavaScript sends to Java the following JSON string:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><tt>{"fname": "Alex", "lname":"Smith","skillLevel": 11}</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Java code can turn it into an instance of the Customer object by calling the method <tt>Gson.fromJson()</tt>. Similarly, Java code can create a JSON string from an object instance. Both of these operations are illustrated below.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">public Customer createCustomerFromJson(String jsonString){

    Gson myGson = new Gson();
    Customer cust = myGson.fromJson(jsonString, Customer.class);
    return cust;
}

public String createJsonFromCustomer(Customer cust){

	Gson gson = new Gson();

	return gson.toJson(cust, Customer.class);
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Of course, the declaration of the Java class <tt>Customer</tt> must exist in the in the classpath and don&#8217;t forget to include gson.jar to your Java project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JSON data format is often used in non-JavaScript applications. For example, a Java server can exchange the JSON-formatted data with a .Net server.</p>

        The upcoming Java EE 7 specification includes JSR 353, which defines a standardized way for parsing and generating JSON. JSR 353 defines the Java API from JSON Processing (JSON-P) that shouldn&#8217;t be confused with another acronym <a href="http://json-p.org/">JSONP or JSON-P</a>, which is JSON with Padding (we&#8217;ll discuss it at the end of this chapter).

  <h3 id="_compressing_json">Compressing JSON</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JSON format is more compact than XML and is readable by the human beings. But when you are ready to deploy your application in production, you still want to compress the data so less bytes will travel over the wire to the user&#8217;s browser. The server-side libraries that generate JSON will make the data sent to the client compact by removing the tab and the new line characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you want to turn the pretty-print JSON into a more compact one-line format just use such Web sites as <a href="http://javascriptcompressor.com/">JavaScript Compressor</a> or <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/json-formatter.html/">JSON Formatter</a>. For example, after running the 12Kb file countries.json through this compressor, its size was decreased to 9Kb. JSONLint can also compress JSON if you provide this URL: <a href="http://jsonlint.com?reformat=compress">http://jsonlint.com?reformat=compress</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Similarly to most of the content that is being sent to browsers by the Web servers, the JSON data should be compressed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">GZip</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE">Deflate</a> are the two main compression methods used in today&#8217;s Web. Both use the same compression algorithm <em>deflate</em>, but while with Deflate the compressed data are being streamed to the client, the GZip first compresses the entire file, calculates the size and adds some additional headers to the compressed data. So GZip may need some extra time and memory, but you are more protected from getting incomplete JSON, JavaScript or other content. Both Gzip and Deflate are easily configurable by major Web servers, but it&#8217;s hard to say which one is better for your application - set up some tests with each of them and decide which one works faster or take less system resources, but don&#8217;t compromise on reliability of the compressed content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We prefer using GZip, which stands for GNU zip compression. On the server side you&#8217;d need to configure the gzip filters on your Web server. You need to refer to your Web server&#8217;s documentation to find out how to configure gzipping, which is done by the MIME type. For example, you can request to gzip everything except images (you might want to do this if you&#8217;re not sure if all browsers can properly uncompress certain MIME types).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For example, applying the GZip filter to the 9Kb countries.json will reduce its size to 3Kb, which means serious bandwidth savings especially in the Web applications with lots of concurrent users. This is even more important for the mobile Web clients, which may be operating in the areas with slower connections. The Web clients can set the HTTP request attribute <tt>Accept-Encoding: gzip</tt> inviting the server to return gzipped content, and the Web server may compress the response if it does support it or unzipped content otherwise. If the server supports gzip, the HTTP response will have the attribute <tt>Content-Encoding: gzip</tt>, and the browser will know to unzip the response data before use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Gzip is being used for compressing all types of content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. If your server sends JSON content to the client setting the content type to <tt>application/json</tt> don&#8217;t forget to include this MIME type in your server configuration for Gzip.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Web browsers support the gzipping too, and your application can set <tt>Content-Ecoding: gzip</tt> in HTTP request while sending the data from the Web client to the server. But Web clients usually don&#8217;t send massive amounts of data to the server so the benefits of the compression on the client side may not be as big.</p>

  <h3 id="_adding_charts_to_save_sick_child">Adding Charts to Save Sick Child</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s consider yet another use case for JSON in Save Sick Child. We want to display charts with statistics about the donations.  By now, our application look not exactly as the original mockup from <a href="#FIG3-2">The main view before clicking Donate Now</a>, but it&#8217;s pretty close. There is an empty space in the left to the maps, and the charts showing donation statistics can fit right in. Now we need to decide how to draw the charts using nothing, but HTML5 elements. Note that we are not talking about displaying static images using the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt> element - the goal is to draw the images dynamically in the client&#8217;s code. You can accomplish this goal using HTML5 elements <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;svg&gt;</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/canvas"><tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt></a> element provides a bitmap canvas, where your  scripts which can draw graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly without using any plugins like Flash Player or Silverlight. To put it simple, the <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> defines a rectangular area that consists of pixels, where your code can draw. Keep in mind that the DOM object can&#8217;t peek inside the canvas and access specific pixels. So if you are planning to create an area with dynamically changed graphics you might want to consider using <tt>&lt;svg&gt;</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/"><tt>&lt;svg&gt;</tt> element</a> supports Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which is the XML-based language for describing two-dimensional graphics. Your code has to provide commands to draw the lines, text, images et al.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s review some code fragments from the Aptana&#8217;s project-12-canvas-pie-chart-json. The HTML section defines <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> of 260x240 pixels. If the user&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt>, the user won&#8217;t see the chart, but will see the text "Your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas" instead. You need to give an ID to your canvas element so your JavaScript code can access it.</p>

  <p>Since the SVG is XML-based, its very easy to generate the code shown in <a href="#FIG4-7">The chart content in SVG</a> on the server, and lots of Web applications send ready to display SVG graphics to the users' Web browsers. But in our example we are generating the SVG output in the JavaScript from JSON received from the server, which provides a cleaner separation between the client and the server-side code. The final decision on what to send to the Web browser (ready to render SVG or raw JSON) has to be made after considering various factors such as available bandwidth, the size of data, the number of users, the existing load on the server resources.</p>

  <h3 id="_what_is_jsonp">What is JSONP</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>JSONP is a technique used in to relax the cross-origin restrictions in cases when a Web page was loaded from the domain abc.com and needs JSON-formatted data from another domain xyz.com.  With JSONP, instead of sending plain JSON data, the server wraps them up into a JavaScript function and then sends it to the Web browser for execution as a callback. The Web page that was originated from abc.com may send the request <tt>http://xyz.com?callback=myDataHandler</tt> technically requesting the server xyz.com to invoke the JavaScript callback named <tt>myDataHandler</tt>. This URL is a regular HTTP GET request, which may have other parameters too so you can send some data to the server too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The server will send to the browser the JavaScript function that may look as follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><tt>function myDataHandler({"fname": "Alex", "lname":"Smith","skillLevel": 11});</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Web browser will invoke the callback <tt>myDataHandler()</tt>, which must exist in the Web page. The Web browser will pass the received JSON object as an argument to this callback:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">function myDataHandler(data){
  // process the content of the argument data - the JSON object
  // received from xyz.com
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If all you need is just to retrieve the data from a different domain on page just add the following tag to your HTML page:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><tt>&lt;script src="http://xyz.com?callback=myDataHandler"&gt;</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But what if you need to dynamically make such requests periodically (e.g. get all twits with a hashtag <tt>#savisickchild</tt> by sending an HTTP GET using Twitter API at <tt>http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=savesickchild&amp;rpp=5&amp;include_entities=true&amp;with_twitter_user_id=true&amp;result_type=mixed</tt>)? You may also need to make requests to a different server when the user selected a certain option on your Web page. You can achieve this by dynamically adding a <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> tag to the DOM object from your JavaScript code. Whenever the browser sees the new <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> element it executes it. Such script injection can be done like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var myScriptTag = document.createElement("script");
myScriptTag.src = "http://xyz.com?callback=myDataHandler";
document.getElementsByTagName("body").appendChild(myScriptTag);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Your JavaScript can build the URL for the <tt>myScriptTag.src</tt> dynamically and pass parameters to the server based on some user&#8217;s actions, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">myScriptTag.src = "http://xyz.com?city=Boston&amp;callback=myDataHandler";</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Of course, this technique presents a danger if there is a chance that the JavaScript code sent by xyz.com is intercepted and replaced by a malicious code. But it&#8217;s not more dangerous that receiving any JavaScript from non-trusted  server. Besides, your handler function could always make sure that the received data is a valid object with expected properties, and only after that handle the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you decide to use JSONP don&#8217;t forget about error handling. Most likely you&#8217;ll be using one of the JavaScript frameworks and they usually offer a standard mechanism for JSONP error handling, dealing with poorly formatted JSON responses, and recovery in cases of network failure. One of such libraries is called <a href="https://github.com/jaubourg/jquery-jsonp">jQuery-JSONP</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this chapter you&#8217;ve learned about using AJAX as a means of communications of your Web browser with the servers. AJAX also deserves a credit for making the JavaScript language popular again by showing a practical way of creating single-page Web applications. Over the years JSON became the standard way of exchanging the data on the Web. The current version of the Save Sick Child application cleanly separates the code from the data, and you know how to update the content of the Web page without the need to re-retrieve the entire page from the server. In the next chapter you&#8217;ll get familiar with the test-driven way of developing Web applications with JavaScript.</p>

  <p>Up till now we&#8217;ve been using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create the Save Sick Child Web application.  In the real world, developers try to be more productive by using JavaScript libraries and MVC frameworks. Libraries do not dictate how to structure the code of your application - they offer you components that allow to write less code. MVC frameworks force you to organize your code in layers implementing the Model-View-Controller design pattern.  There are more than a dozen MVC JavaScript frameworks that are being used by professional developers: <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs">ExtJS</a>, AngularJS, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> just to name a few. In this chapter we&#8217;ll introduce the JavaScript library called jQuery. It&#8217;s not an architectural framework that will help you in structuring and layering your JavaScript code, and if you feel in need of such help you can build your Web application with one of the MVC frameworks <em>in addition to</em> jQuery library.</p>

  <p><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is the most popular JavaScript library. More than 60% of top Web sites use jQuery (visit <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/top">http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/top</a> for the current statistics). jQuery is simple to use and doesn&#8217;t require you to dramatically change the way you program for the Web. jQuery offers you a helping hand with the tasks that most of the Web developers need to deal with, for example, finding and manipulating DOM elements, processing browser&#8217;s events, and dealing with browser incompatibility. Since jQuery is an extensible framework, lots and lots of plugins were created by developers from around the world, and all of them are available for free. If you can&#8217;t find the plugin that fits your need you can create one yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Besides jQuery and jQuery Mobile there is a <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI library</a>, which is a set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery. You can find in jQuery UI such widgets as Datepicker, Accordion, Slider, Tabs, Autocomplete and more. jQuery UI will also help you with adding to your Web page various interactions (e.g. drag and drop)  and effects (e.g. adding CSS classes or animations). jQuery UI is built on top of jQuery Core library and can&#8217;t be used independently. jQuery UI is covered in the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023159.do">O&#8217;Reilly book "jQuery UI"</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this chapter we&#8217;ll briefly cover the basics of the Core jQuery library. Our goal is not to provide you with a detailed jQuery primer - there are jQuery books and <a href="http://api.jquery.com/">the online API Documentation</a> that provide a comprehensive explanation of jQuery. But we&#8217;ll give you just enough of the information to  understand how jQuery can be used. In the section Working on Save Sick Child we&#8217;ll review the code of several versions of this application highlighting the benefits of using JQuery library.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_jquery_intro">jQuery Intro</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>At the time of this writing the current version of jQuery is 1.9.1 You can download one of two distributions of jQuery library. The gzipped minified version of jQuery weighs 33Kb (it&#8217;s 93Kb if unzipped), and this is all you need unless you are planning to develop jQuery plugins, in which case get a larger development version - it&#8217;s about 270Kb. We&#8217;ve downloaded it from jquery.com and included it in the <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> tag in our HTML code samples so you can run them even if the Internet connection is not available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But instead of deploying jQuery framework on your servers as a part of your application, you should use a common Content Delivery Network (CDN) URL in your HTML as shown below. Since jQuery is an extremely popular library, many Web sites use it. If more than one Web page would get it from the same CDN, the Web browser would cache it locally and reuse it rather than downloading a separate copy from different servers for every Web application that uses jQuery. The <a href="http://jquery.com/download/">download page of jquery.com</a> offers three CDN: Google, Microsoft, and MediaTemple. For example, if you don&#8217;t need to use HTTPS protocol with your application the MediaTemple&#8217;s CDN suffice:</p>

But keep in mind that by doing this you may run into a situation when some of the API of jQuery has been changed or deprecated. For example, jQuery 2.0 <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/01/jquery-1-9-and-2-0-tldr-edition/">will not support</a> Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 and automatically switching to the latest version may result in malfunctioning of your application.

We won&#8217;t add any new functionality to this application - we want to show that the developers can be more productive in achieving the same result.</p>

  <p>Some people will say that anyone who knows HTML can easily learn jQuery, but this is not so. Understanding of JavaScript is required. If you&#8217;ve read and understood the content from Chapter 1 - you&#8217;re ready to learn jQuery.  The jQuery programming starts with with invoking the jQuery constructor named <tt>jQuery()</tt>. But people are using the shorter version of this constructor that&#8217;s represented by a $ sign: <tt>$()</tt>. This <tt>$</tt> property is the only object that jQuery will create in the global namespace. Everything else will be encapsulated inside the <tt>$</tt> object.</p>

        While it&#8217;s easier to write <tt>$()</tt> than <tt>jQuery()</tt>, keep in mind that if you decide to use in your application another library in addition to jQuery, with the chances are higher to run into a conflict of having another <tt>$</tt> than another <tt>jQuery</tt> in the global name space. To make sure you won&#8217;t find yourself in the "Another day, another $" position, put your code inside a closure, passing it <tt>JQuery</tt>. The following code allows you to safely use the <tt>$</tt> object:

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>As you remember, JavaScript functions do not require you to invoke them with exactly the same number of parameters as they were declared with. Hence, when you invoke jQuery constructor you can pass different things to it. You can pass a String as an argument or another function, and jQuery constructor will invoke different code based on the argument type. For example, if you&#8217;ll pass it a String, jQuery will assume that it&#8217;s a CSS selector, and the caller wants to find element(s) in the DOM that match this selector. Basically, you may think of it this way - whenever you want jQuery do something for you, invoke <tt>$()</tt> passing it your request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You&#8217;ll need to get used to yet another feature of jQuery - method chaining. Each function returns an object, and you don&#8217;t have to declare a variable to hold this object. You can just write something like <tt>funcA().funcB();</tt> This means that the method <tt>funcB()</tt> will be called on the object, returned by the <tt>funcA()</tt>.</p>

        While method chaining is often presented as a great feature allowing to do more with less typing,
it may complicate debugging of your code. Imagine that <tt>funcA()</tt> returned null for whatever reason. The entire chain (the <tt>funcB()</tt> in our example) that was attached to <tt>funcA()</tt> won&#8217;t be working properly, and you&#8217;ll need to unchain these methods to find the problem.

  <p>Probably the most frequently used routine in a JavaScript code that&#8217;s part of the HTML page is finding DOM elements and making some manipulations with them, and this is where the jQuery&#8217;s power is. Finding HTML elements based on the CSS selectors is very easy and concise. You can specify one or more selectors in the same query.

  <p>If jQuery selector returns a number of HTML elements, you can further narrow down this collection by applying so-called filters.jQuery has such filters as <tt>eq()</tt>, <tt>has()</tt>, <tt>first()</tt> and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For example, applying the selector <tt>$('label');`to the Donate section HTML fragment shown in &lt;&lt;FIG5-1&gt;&gt; would return a set of HTML elements `&lt;label&gt;</tt>. Say we want to change the background of the label "20" to be red. This is the third label in the HTML from <a href="#FIG5-1">Testing jQuery using JSFiddle</a>, and the <tt>eq(n)</tt> filter selects the element at the zero-based index <tt>n</tt> within the matched set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You can apply this filter using the following syntax: <tt>$('label:eq(2)');</tt>. But jQuery documentation suggest to use the syntax <tt>$('label').eq(2);</tt> <a href="http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/">for better performance</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Using method chaining we&#8217;ll apply the filter  <tt>eq(2)</tt> to the set of lables returned by the selector <tt>$('label')</tt> and then and then change the styling of the remaining HTML element(s) using the <tt>css()</tt> method that can do all CSS manipulations. This is how the entire expression will look like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$('label').eq(2).css('background-color', 'red');</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Test this script in JSFiddle or in the code of one of the Save Sick Child projects from this chapter. The background of the label "20" will become red. If you wanted to change the CSS of the first label in this set, the filter expressions could look as <tt>$('label:first')</tt> or, for the better performance, you should do it like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$('label').filter(":first").css('background-color', 'red');</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you display data in HTML table, you may want to change the background color of every even or odd row <tt>&lt;tr&gt;</tt>,  and jQuery offers you the filters <tt>even()</tt> and <tt>odd()</tt>, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">

  <h3 id="_events">Events</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Adding events processing with jQuery is simple, and your code will be following the same pattern: find the element in DOM using selector or filter, and then attach the appropriate function that handles the event. We&#8217;ll show you a handful of code sample of how to do it, but you can find the description of all methods that deal with events in the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/events/">jQuery API documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Our Hello World example used a short version of passing the handler function to the <tt>ready()</tt> function:
<tt>$(function());</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This is the same as using the following syntax:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><tt>$(document).ready(function());</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For the Hello World example this was all that mattered - we just needed to have the DOM object to be able to append the <tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt> element to it. But this would not be the right solution if the code needs to be executed only after all page resources have been loaded. In such case the code could have been re-written to utilize the DOM&#8217;s <tt>window.load</tt> event, which in jQuery looks as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$(window).load(function(){
		$("body").append("&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;");
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the user interacts with your Web page using the mouse , the events handlers can be added using a similar procedure. For example, if you want the header in our Hello World example to process click events, find the reference to this header and attach the <tt>click()</tt> handler to it. Adding the following to the <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> section of Hello World will append the text each time the user clicks on the header.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$("h1").click(function(event){
    $("body").append("Hey, you clicked on the header!");
})</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you&#8217;d like to process double-clicks - replace the <tt>click()</tt> invocation with <tt>dblclick()</tt>. jQuery has handlers for about a dozen mouse events, which are wrapper methods to the corresponding JavaScript events that are dispatched when mouse entering or leaving the area, the mouse pointer goes up/down, or the focus moves in or out of an input field. The shorthand methods <tt>click()</tt> and <tt>dblclick()</tt> (and several others) internally use the method <tt>on()</tt>, which you can and should use in your code too.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_binding_events_with_the_method_on">Binding Events With The Method on()</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The event methods can be attached just by passing a handler function as it was done in the above examples, or to process the event or by using the <tt>on()</tt> method, which allows you to specify the native event name and the event handler as its arguments. In the section Working on Save Sick Child you&#8217;ll see lots of examples, where the <tt>on()</tt> method is used. The one liner below assigns the function handler named <tt>showLoginForm</tt> to the <tt>click</tt> event of the element with the id <tt>login-link</tt>. The following code snippets includes the commented out pure-JavaScript version of the code (see project-02-login in Chapter 3) that has the same functionality:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">    // var loginLink = document.getElementById("login-link");
    // loginLink.addEventListener('click', showLoginForm, false);

	$('#login-link').on('click', showLoginForm);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>on()</tt> method allows you to assign the same handler function to more than one event. For example, to invoke the <tt>showLoginForm</tt> function when the user clicks or moves the mouse over the HTML element you could written  <tt>on('click mouseover', showLoginForm)</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The method <tt>off()</tt> is used for removing the event handler and the event won&#8217;t be processed anymore. For example, if you want to turn off the login link&#8217;s ability to process <tt>click</tt> event, simply write this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">	$('#login-link').off('click', showLoginForm);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_delegated_events">Delegated Events</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The method <tt>on()</tt> can be called with passing an optional selector as an argument. Since we haven&#8217;t used it in the example from the previous section, the event was triggered only when reached the element with an id <tt>login-link</tt>. Now imagine an HTML container that has child elements, e.g. a calculator implemented as a <tt>&lt;div id="calculator"&gt;</tt> containing buttons. The following code would assign a click handler <strong>to each</strong> button stlyled with a class <tt>.digitButton</tt>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$("div#calculator .digitButton").on("click", function(){...});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But instead of assigning an event handler to each button, you can assign an event handler to the container and specify additional selector that child elements may be found by. The following code assigns the event handler function <strong>to only one</strong> object - the <tt>div#calculator</tt> instructing this container to invoke the event handler when any of its children matching <tt>.digitButton</tt> is clicked.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$("div#calculator").on("click", ".digitButton",function(){...});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When the button is clicked, the event bubbles up and reaches the container&#8217;s level, whose click handler will do the processing. The work on processing clicks for digit buttons is delegated to the container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Another good use case for delegating event processing to a container is a financial application that displays the data in an HTML table containing hundreds of rows. Instead of assigning event hundreds event handlers (one per table row), assign one to the table. There is one extra benefit to using delegation in this case - if the application can dynamically add new rows to this table (say, the order execution data), there is no need to explicitly assign event handlers to them - the container will do the processing for both old and new rows.</p>

        Starting from jQuery 1.7, the method <tt>on()</tt> is a recommended replacement of the methods <tt>bind()</tt>, <tt>unbind()</tt>, <tt>delegate()</tt>, and <tt>undelegate()</tt> that are still being used in earlier versions of jQuery.  If you decide to develop your application with jQuery and its mobile version with jQuery Mobile, you need to be aware that the latter may not implement the latest code of the core jQuery.  Using <tt>on()</tt> is safe though, because at the time of this writing jQuery Mobile 1.2 supports all the features of jQuery 1.8.2. In Chapter 11, you&#8217;ll see how using the responsive design principles can help you to reuse the same code on both desktop and mobile devices.

  <h3 id="_ajax_with_jquery">AJAX with jQuery</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Making AJAX requests to the server is also easier with jQuery than with pure JavaScript. All the complexity of <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/"><tt>$.ajax()</tt></a> method is hidden from the developers. This method spares JavaScript developers from writing the code with multiple browser-specific ways of instantiating the <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> object. By invoking <tt>ajax()</tt> you can exchange the data with the server and load the JavaScript code. In its simplest form, this method takes just the URL of the remote resource to which the request is sent. Such invocation will use global defaults that should have been set in advance by invoking the method <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/"><tt>ajaxSetup()</tt></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But you can combine specifying parameters of the AJAX call and making the <tt>ajax()</tt> call. Just provide as an argument a configuration object that defines the URL, the function handlers for success and failures, and some other parameters like a function to call right before the AJAX request (<tt>beforeSend</tt>) or caching instructions for the browser (<tt>cache</tt>). Spend some time getting familiar with all different configuration parameters that you can use with the jQuery method <tt>ajax()</tt>. A sample  template for calling jQuery <tt>ajax()</tt> may look as shown below.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$.ajax({

	}).done(function (data) {...})
	  .fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus) {...
	});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This example takes a JavaScript object that defines three properties: the URL, the type of the request,  and the expected data type. Using chaining, you can attach the methods <tt>done()</tt> and <tt>fail()</tt>, which have to specify the function handlers to be invoked in case of success and failure respectively. Don&#8217;t forget about the asynchronous nature of  AJAX calls, which means that the <tt>ajax()</tt> method  will be finished before the <tt>done()</tt> or <tt>fail()</tt> callbacks will be invoked. You may attach another  <em>promised callback</em> method <tt>always()</tt> that will be invoked regardless of if the <tt>ajax()</tt> call succeeds or fails. The <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR</a> is a jQuery wrapper for the browser&#8217;s  <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To support chaining of asynchronous callbacks (<tt>done()</tt>, <tt>fail()</tt>, <tt>always()</tt>) that don&#8217;t need to be called right away - they wait for the result - the method <tt>ajax()</tt> returns so called Deferred object that places these callbacks in a queue to be called later. As a matter of fact, the callback <tt>fail()</tt> may never be called.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you&#8217;ll specify JSON as a value of the <tt>dataType</tt> property, the result will be parsed automatically by jQuery - there is no need to call <tt>JSON.parse()</tt> as it was done in Chapter 4. Even though the jQuery object has a utility  method <tt>parseJSON()</tt>, you don&#8217;t have to invoke it to process return of the <tt>ajax()</tt> call.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the above example the type of the AJAX request was <tt>GET</tt>. But you can use <tt>POST</tt> too. In this case you&#8217;ll need to prepare valid JSON data to be sent to the server. In this case the configuration object that you provide as an argument to the method <tt>ajax()</tt> has to include the property <tt>data</tt> containing valid JSON.</p>

  <h4 id="_handy_shorthand_methods">Handy Shorthand Methods</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>jQuery has several shorthand methods that allow making AJAX calls with the simpler syntax, which we&#8217;ll consider next.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The method <a href="http://api.jquery.com/load/"><tt>load()</tt></a> makes an AJAX call from an HTML element(s) to the specified URL (the first argument) and populates the HTML element with the returned data. You can pass optional second and third arguments: HTTP request parameters and the callback function to process the results. If the second argument is an object, the <tt>load()</tt> method will make a <tt>POST</tt> request, otherwise - <tt>GET</tt>. You&#8217;ll see the code that uses <tt>load()</tt> to populate states and countries from remote HTML files later in this chapter in the section on bringing the states and countries from remote HTML files. But the next line shows an example of calling <tt>load()</tt> with two parameters: the URL and the callback:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript"> $('#counriesList').load('data/countries.html', function(response, status, xhr){...});</code></pre>

<div class="admonitionblock">
  <table>
    <tr>

        <div class="title">Tip</div>
        
      </td>
      <td class="content">
        
        You can use the function <tt>load()</tt> to load SVG images asynchronously.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The global method <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/"><tt>get()</tt></a> allows you to specifically issue an HTTP <tt>GET</tt> request. Similarly to the <tt>ajax()</tt> invocation, you can chain the <tt>done(),</tt> <tt>fail()</tt>, and <tt>always()</tt> methods to <tt>get()</tt>, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$.get('ssc/getDonors?city=Miami', function(){alert("Got the donors");})
  .done(function(){alert("I'm called after the donors retrieved");}
  .fail(function(){alert("Request for donors failed");});
;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The global method <tt>post()</tt> makes an HTTP <tt>POST</tt> request to the server. You must specify at least one argument - the URL on the server, and, optionally, the data to be passed, the callback to be invoked on the request completion, and the type of data expected from the server. Similarly to the <tt>ajax()</tt> invocation, you can chain the <tt>done(),</tt> <tt>fail()</tt>, and <tt>always()</tt> methods to <tt>post()</tt>. The following example makes a <tt>POST</tt> request to the server passing an object with the new donor information.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The global method <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/"><tt>getJSON()</tt></a> retrieves and parses the JSON data from the specified URL and passes the JavaScript object to the specified callback. If need be, you can send the data to the server with the request. Callinf <tt>getJSON()</tt> is like calling <tt>ajax()</tt> with parameter <tt>dataType: "json"</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">

          .fail(function(){alert("Request for us states failed");});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The method <a href="http://api.jquery.com/serialize/"><tt>serialize()</tt></a> is used when you need to submit to the server a filled out HTML <tt>&lt;form&gt;</tt>. This method presents the form data as a text sting in a standard URL-encoded notation. Typically, the code finds a required form using jQuery selector and then calls <tt>serialize()</tt> on this object. But you can invoke <tt>serialize()</tt> not only on the entire form, but on selected form elements too. Belows is a sample code that finds the form and serializes it.</p>

  <p>In this section we&#8217;ll review code samples from several Aptana projects that are jQuery re-writes of the corresponding pure-JavaScript projects from Chapters 3 and 4. We are not going to add any new functionality - the goal is to demonstrate how jQuery allows you to achieve the same results with writing less code.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_login_and_donate">Login and Donate</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For example, the file main.js from project-02-jQuery-Login is 33% less in size than project-02-login. jQuery is brief. For example, the next code shows how six lines of code in JavaScript can be replaced with one - the jQuery function <tt>toggle()</tt> will toggle the visibility of <tt>login-link</tt>, <tt>login-form</tt>, and <tt>login-submit</tt>.</p>

// loginForm.style.display = "block";
// loginSubmit.style.display = "block";


// The jQuery way
$('#login-link, #login-form, #login-submit').toggle();
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The code of the Donation section also becomes slimmer with jQuery. For example, the following section from the JavaScript version of the application is removed:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var donateBotton = document.getElementById('donate-button');
var donationAddress = document.getElementById('donation-address');
var donateFormContainer = document.getElementById('donate-form-container');

var donateLaterLink = document.getElementById('donate-later-link');</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>jQuery includes <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/">a number of effects</a> that make the user experience more engaging. Let&#8217;s use one of them called <tt>fadeToggle()</tt>. In the code above there is a section that toggles visibility of the Donate form. If the user clicks on the Donate button, the form becomes visible (see <a href="#FIG3-11">After clicking on Donate button</a>). If the user clicks on the link "I&#8217;ll donate later", the form becomes hidden as in <a href="#FIG3-10">The initial view of the Donate section</a>. The jQuery method <tt>toggle()</tt> does its job, but the change happens abruptly. The effect <tt>fadeToggle()</tt> allows to introduce slower fading which improves the user experience, at least to our taste.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the code would hide/show just one component, the code change would be trivial - replacing <tt>toggle()</tt> with <tt>fadeToggle('slow')</tt> would do the trick.  But in our case, the toggle changes visibility of two <tt>&lt;div&gt;'s</tt>: <tt>donation-address</tt> and <tt>donation-form-container</tt>, which should happen in a certain order. The code below is a replacement of the show/hide section in the main.js to introduce the fading effect.</p>

  <p>If you simply want to submit this form to the URL listed in its <tt>action</tt> property when the user clicks on the button submit, there is nothing else to be done. This already works and Paypal&#8217;s login page opens up in the browser. But if you wanted to seamlessly integrate your page with Paypal or any other third-party service, a preferred way is not to send the user to the third-party Web site, but do it without leaving your Web application.  We won&#8217;t be implementing such integration with Paypal here, but technically it would be possible to pass the user&#8217;s credentials and bank information to charge the donor of Save Sick Child without even opening the Paypal Web page in the browser. To do this, you&#8217;d need to submit the form using AJAX and Paypal API with processing the results of this transaction using the standardAJAX techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To post the form to a specified URL using jQuery AJAX we&#8217;ll serialize the data from the form on <tt>submit</tt> event. The code fragment from main.js finds the form with ID <tt>donate-form</tt> and chains to it the <tt>submit()</tt> method passing to it a callback that will prepare the data and make an AJAX call. You may use the method <tt>submit()</tt> instead of attaching an event handler to process clicks on the button donate - the method <tt>submit()</tt> will be invoked not only on the Submit button click event, but when the user presses the Enter key while the cursor is in one of the form&#8217;s input fields.</p>

    <div class="title">Installing the XAMPP server with PHP support</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To see this PHP script in action, it has to be deployed in any Web server that supports PHP. For example, you can install on your computer the XAMPP package from the <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html"> Apache Friends web site</a>, which includes Apache Web Server that supports PHP, FTP, preconfigured MYSQL database server(we are not going to use it). The installation process is very simple - just go through the short instructions on the Apache Friends website that are applicable for your OS. Start the XAMPP Control application and click on the button Start next to the label Apache. By default, Apache server starts on the port 80, so entering <strong><a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a></strong> will open the XAMPP welcome page.</p>

  </table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The directory xampp/htdocs is the document root of the Apache Web Server, hence you can place the index.html of your project there or in one of its subdirectories. To test that a PHP is supported, just save the following code in the  helloworld.php in the htdocs directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The easiest way to test the project-15-jQuery-serialize-form that uses demo.php is to copy this folder from Aptana into the htdocs directory of your XAMPP install (just drag and drop this folder from Aptana to your file system). Then enter the URL <a href="http://localhost/project-15-jquery-serialize-form/">http://localhost/project-15-jquery-serialize-form/</a> in your Web browser and you&#8217;ll see the Save Sick Child application. Then fill out the form and click on the Donate Now button. The form will be serialized and submitted to the demo.php as explained above. If you&#8217;ll open Google Developers Tools in the Network tab you&#8217;ll see that the demo.php has received the AJAX request and the console will show the output similar to the following (for Alex Smith, alex@gmail.com):</p>

  <p>Since a large portion of the readers didn&#8217;t have Apache pre-installed, we&#8217;ll continue using the XAMPP package. First, create a subdirectory in the document root of your server (in case of Apache Web server it&#8217;s htdocs). If you start from scratch, create a new Aptana&#8217;s workspace in this directory by selecting the menu File | Switch Workspace | Other. If you just want to create a single new project to be used with Apache, while creating a new project (its name doesn&#8217;t matter), uncheck the option "Use Default Location" and select a folder that you have created under xampp/htdocs, for example xampp/htdocs/ssc. Now create a folder in your Aptana&#8217;s App Explorer view for your new Web application, e.g. helloworld. Then create an hello.html inside this folder.</p>

You&#8217;ll see the Web page that read "Hello from under XAMPP".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The other choice is to configure an external Web server (Apache) in Aptana and create a <em>Run Configuration</em> that will know that hello.html has to be run using this server.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Pretty often you need to add a rotation of the images feature to a Web page. The Save Sick Chile page, for example, could rotate the images of the kids saved by the donors. To give you yet another illustration of using jQuery plugin, we&#8217;ve created the project called project-16-jQuery slider, where we integrated the jQuery plugin called Responsive Carousel.  The file index.html of this project includes the CSS styles and the JavaScript code plugin as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/responsive-carousel.css" /&gt;

&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/responsive-carousel.fade.css" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/responsive-carousel.flip.css" /&gt;
...
&lt;script src="js/plugins/responsive-carousel/responsive-carousel.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js/plugins/responsive-carousel/responsive-carousel.flip.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We ran into issue as this version of the Resonsive Carousel plugin was using the method <tt>live()</tt> that was deprecated in jQuery 1.7 and removed in jQuery 1.9. After consulting with the <a href="http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/">jQuery Core 1.9 Upgrade Guide</a> we&#8217;ve replaced all the occurrences of <tt>live()</tt> with <tt>on()</tt> right inside the file responsive-carousel.min.js, and the plugin started working fine.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

  <p>With this plugin, the JavaScript code that the application developer has to write to implement several types of rotation is minimal. When the user clicks on the one of the radio buttons (Fade, Slide, or Flip transitions) the code below just changes the CSS class name to be used with the carousel.</p>

  <p>The Validator and Responsive Carousel clearly demonstrate that jQuery plugins can save you some serious time of writing code to implement some commonly required features. It&#8217;s great that the members of the jQuery community from around the world share their creations with other developers. If you can&#8217;t find a plugin that fits your needs or have specific custom logic that needs to be used or reused in your application.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this chapter you became familiar with the jQuery Core library, which became the de-facto standard library in millions Web applications. Its simplicity and extensibility via the mechanism of plugins made it a must have in almost every Web page. Even if your organization standardizes decides on a more complex and feature-rich JavaScript framework, the chances are that you may find a handy jQuery plugin that fill complement "the main" framework and made it into the code of your application. There is nothing wrong with this and you shouldn&#8217;t be in the position of "either jQuery or XYZ" - they can coexist in your Web application.</p>

  <div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the previous chapter you&#8217;ve got familiar with the JavaScript library jQuery. Now we&#8217;ll introduce you to a more complex product - a JavaScript framework <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs">Ext JS</a> from <a href="http://www.sencha.com">Sencha</a>. This is one of the most feature-complete frameworks available on the market, and you should give it a serious consideration while deciding on the tooling for your next enterprise HTML5 application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Providing detailed coverage of Ext JS framework in on chapter is mission impossible. The material in this chapter is divided into three parts:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p>You&#8217;ll get a high level overview of the Ext JS framework.</p>

      <p>We&#8217;ll do a code review of a new version of the Save Sick Child application developed with Ext JS. This is where we want you to spend most of the time in this chapter. Learn while studying commented code. We&#8217;ve also provided multiple links to the relevant product documentation.</p>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_why_ext_js">Why Ext JS?</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After learning how jQuery library can simplify development of the HTML5 applications you might be wondering, what&#8217;s so good about Ext JS framework that makes it worthwhile for studying. First of all, Core jQuery is just a library of utilities that simplify working with DOM and - you still need to write the Web application using HTML and JavaScript. In addition to it, there are lots and lots of jQuery plugins that include handy widgets to add to your manually created Web site. There are other HTML5 frameworks that help better organizing your project (e.g. Angular.js) or modularizing your project (e.g. Require.js), but enterprise application may need more. So here comes the Ext JS sales pitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p>Ext JS an HTML5 framework that doesn&#8217;t require you to write HTML. Yes, your only tiny HTML file will just include three files: one  with Ext JS framework, one CSS file, and one <em>app.js</em>, but the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> section will be empty.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Ext JS offers you a comprehensive JavaScript-based classes that include pretty much everything you need to develop a Web application (UI components, UI layouts, collections, networking, collections, CSS compiler, packaging tool, and more).</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Ext JS offers you a way to write object-oriented code, define classes and inheritance in a way that&#8217;s closer to classical inheritance and doesn&#8217;t require the <tt>prototype</tt> property.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Ext JS can jump start your application development by generating the initial code layered according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Ext JS is a cross-browser framework that promises to automatically take care of all differences in major Web browsers.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you just finished reading the jQuery chapter, you&#8217;ll need to switch to a different state of mind. Core jQuery library was light, it didn&#8217;t drastically change the way of developing pure HTML/JavaScript applications. But working with Ext JS framework is a completely different ball game. It&#8217;s not about improving an existing Web page, it&#8217;s about re-writing it from scratch without using HTML.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Ext JS includes a rich library of UI components, a flexible class system, custom layouts, code generators. But Web browsers understand only HTML, DOM, CSS, and JavaScript. This means that the framework will have to do some extra work in converting the code written using the home-made Ext JS class system into same old HTML objects. Such extra work requires additional time, and we&#8217;ll discuss this in the section titled "The Components Lifecycle".</p>

  <h3 id="_downloading_and_installing_ext_js">Downloading and Installing Ext JS</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>First, you need to know that <em>Ext JS</em> framework can be used for free only for non-commercial projects. To use  Ext JS for enterprise Web development you or your firm has to purchase one of the <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/license/">Ext JS licenses</a>. But for studying, you can download the complete commercial version of Ext JS for free for the 45-days evaluation period.</p>

  </table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After downloading the Ext JS framework, unzip it to any directory of your choice - later on the framework will be copied either in in your project directory (see the Sencha CMD section below) or in the document root of your Web server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After unzipping the Ext JS distribution, you&#8217;ll find a number of files and folders there. There are several JavaScript files containing differently packages Ext JS framework. You&#8217;ll need to pick just one of these files. The files that include the word <em>all</em> in their names contain the entire framework and if you&#8217;ll include one of the following files, all the classes will be loaded to the user&#8217;s browser even though your application may never use most of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>ext-all.js - minimized version of the source code of Ext JS, which literally looks like one line of 1.4 million characters (it&#8217;s still JavaScript, of course). Most likely you won&#8217;t deploy this file on your production server.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>ext-all-debug.js - human-readable source code of Ext JS with no comments. If you like to read comments, use ext-all-debug-w-comments.js.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>ext-all-dev.js - human-readable source code of Ext JS that includes console.log() statements that generates and outputs debugging information in the browser&#8217;s console.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Similarly, there are files that don&#8217;t include <em>all</em> in their names: ext.js, ext-debug.js, and ext-dev.js. These are much smaller files that do not include the entire framework, but rather a minimum set of classes required to start the application. Later on, the additional classes may be lazy-loaded on the as-needed basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <em>docs</em> folder contains extensive documentation - just open the file index.html in your browser and start reading and studying.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <em>builds</em> folder includes sandboxed versions of Ext JS in case you need to to use say Ext JS 4.2 along with older versions of this framework. Browsing the <em>builds</em> folder reveals that the Ext JS framework consists of three parts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Ext Core - it&#8217;s a free to use <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extcore/">JavaScript library</a> for enhancing Web sites. It supports DOM manipulation with CSS selectors, events and AJAX requests. It also offers a syntax to define and create classes that can extend from each other. The functionality of Ext Core is comparable to Core jQuery, but the latter has a huge community of users and contributors, so it&#8217;s not likely that anyone would be using just Ext Core.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Ext JS - a UI framework that includes a rich library of UI components.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The Foundation - a set of useful utilities.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Such code separation allowed creators of Ext JS reuse a large portion of the framework&#8217;s code in the mobile library Sencha Touch, which we&#8217;ll cover in Chapter 13.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Ext JS framework is large so be prepared that your application will weigh at least 1Mb. So if you just need to create a small Web site, you may be better off by just using a lightweight, easy to learn and free jQuery library or one of a dozen of other JavaScript frameworks that either improve organizational structure of your project or offer a set of a la cart components to prettify your HTML5 application. But if you had a chance to develop or use rich Internet applications developed with such frameworks as Microsoft Silverlight or Apache Flex, then you&#8217;ll quickly realize that Ext JS is the closest by functionality, rich set of components and tools.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This section is not going to be an Ext JS tutorial that gradually explains each and every feature and API of Ext JS. For this we&#8217;d need to write a fat Ext JS book. Sencha published multiple online tutorials, documentation and videos, besides there are several current books written by independent authors. In this section chapter you&#8217;ll get an overview of the framework.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_the_first_version_of_hello_world">The First Version of Hello World</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But we&#8217;ll start with developing a Hello World application before explaining how things work in Ext JS. But the section where we&#8217;ll review the code of the Save Sick Child application will serve as a hands-on way of learning the framework. You&#8217;ll read the code fragments followed by brief explanations. You&#8217;ll be able to run and debug this application on your own computer seeing how various components and program layers work in practice. But first things first - let&#8217;s create a couple of versions of Hello World.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Create a new directory (e.g. <em>hello1</em>). Inside <em>hello1</em> create a subdirectory named <em>ext</em> and copy there the entire content of your Ext JS installation directory. Create yet another subdirectory <em>app</em> inside <em>hello1</em> - this is where your application JavaScript files will go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>At the very minimum, every Ext JS application will contain one HTML and one JavaScript file - usually index.html and app.js. The file index.html will include the references to the CSS and JavaScript code of Ext JS and will include your app.js containing the code of the Hello World application:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="ext/resources/ext-all-gray.css"&gt;
      &lt;script src="ext/ext.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src="app/app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The next comes the content of the app.js that you should place in the <em>app</em> directory of your project. This is how the app.js may look like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">Ext.application({
    launch: function(){
      alert("Hello World");
    }
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This <tt>Ext.application()</tt> method gets a <em>configuration object</em> - JavaScript literal - with configured <tt>launch</tt> method that&#8217;s called automatically when the Web page has completely loaded. In our case it  mandates to launch the anonymous function that displays the "Hello World" message. In Ext JS you&#8217;ll be using such configuration objects a lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Open the file index.html in your Web browser and you&#8217;ll see this greeting. But this was a plain vanilla Hello World. In the next section we&#8217;ll automate the process of creation of a fancier Hello World (or the initial version of any other application) by using the Sencha Cmd tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the pre 4.0 versions ofExt JS you&#8217;d be invoking the <tt>Ext.onReady()</tt> method instead of passing the configuration object with the <tt>launch</tt> <em>config option</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Providing a function argument as a configuration object overrides configurable properties of the current instance of the class. This is different from the class properties, which are defines at the prototype level and changing a values of a property would apply to all instances of the class. When you&#8217;ll be reading Ext JS online documentation for any class, you&#8217;ll three three categories of class elements: Configs, Properties, and Methods. For example, this is how you can create a panel passing configs:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {
    title: 'Hello',
    width: 200,
    html: '&lt;p&gt;World!&lt;/p&gt;',
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

        Ext JS classes are organized into packages. For example, the class <tt>Panel</tt> in the above example is located in the package <tt>Ext.panel</tt>. You&#8217;ll be using packaging in your applications too. For example, later in the chapter you&#8217;ll see classes from Save Sick Child and Clear frameworks named as <tt>SSC.view.DonateForm</tt> or <tt>Clear.override.ExtJSOverrider</tt>. Such packages should be properly <em>namespaced</em> and <tt>SSC</tt> and <tt>Clear</tt> are top-level namespaces here.

  <p>Sencha CMD is a handy command line tool that automates your work starting from scaffolding your application to minimizing, packaging and deploying it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Download Sencha CMD from <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download">http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download</a>. Run the installer, and when it&#8217;s complete, open the Terminal or Command window and enter the command <strong>sencha</strong> - you should see a prompt with all possible commands and options that CMD understands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For example, to generate the initial project structure for HelloWorld application enter the following command, specifying the absolute path to your ExtJS SDK directory (we keep it in the <em>/Library</em> directory) and to the output folder, where the generated project should reside.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

  <p>The generated project is created with the assumption that your application will be built using the MVC paradigm discussed in the section Best Practice:MVC. The JavaScript is located in the <em>app</em> folder, which includes the <em>view</em> subfolder with the visual portion of your application, the <em>controller</em> folder with controller classes, and the <em>model</em> is for data. The <em>ext</em> folder contains multiple distributions of the Ext JS framework. The <em>sass</em> folder is a place for your application&#8217;s CSS files (see the sidebar titled SASS and CSS later in this chapter).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The entry point to your application is index.html, which contains the references to the main application file app.js, the Ext JS framework extdev-js, the CSS file bootstrap.css (imports the classic theme), and the supporting script bootstrap.js, which contains the mapping of the long names if the framework and application classes to their shorter names (<em>xtypes</em>).</p>

  <p>The total size of this version of the Hello World application is pretty large: 4Mb, and the browser makes 173 requests to the server by the time the user sees the application shown on <a href="#FIG6-2">Running the Generated Application</a>. But Sencha Cmd knows how to build the production version of the Ext JS application. It minimizes and merges the application&#8217;s and required framework&#8217;s JavaScript code into one file. The application css file is also minimized and the references to the image resources become relative hence shorter. Besides, the images may be automatically sliced - cut into smaller rectangular pieces that can be downloaded by the browser simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To create optimized version of your application go to the Terminal or a command window and change to the root directory of your application (in our case it&#8217;s <em>/Users/yfain11/hello</em>) and run the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><em>sencha app build</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After the build is finished, you&#8217;ll see newly generated version of the application in the directory <em>build/HelloWorld/production</em>. Open the file index.html while running Chrome Developers Tools, and you&#8217;ll see that the total size of the application is substantially lower (about 900Kb) and the the browser had to make only five requests to the server (see <a href="#FIG6-3">Running production version of HelloWorld</a>). Using gZip will reduce the size of this application to 600Kb, which is still a lot, but Ext JS framework is not the right choice for writing Hello World type of applications or light Web sites.</p>

  <p>Eclipse for Java EE developers comes with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">Web Tools Platform</a> that simplifies development of Web applications by allowing you to create so-called Dynamic Web Project, which will be specifically created for deployment under a particular Java server - Apache Tomcat in our case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To create such a project select Eclipse menu File | New | Other | Web | Dynamic Web Project. It&#8217;ll pop up a window similar to <a href="#FIG6-4">Creating Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse</a>. Note that the Target Runtime is Apache Tomcat v7.0 that we&#8217;ve configured in the previous section.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Upon creation, this project will include several directories, and one of them will be called <em>WebContent</em>. This directory it serves as a document root of the Web server in Eclipse Dymamic Web Projects . This is the place to put your index.html and one of possible places to keep the Ext JS framework.Create a subdirectory <em>ext</em> under <em>WebContent</em> and copy there all files from the Ext JS distribution. The <em>app</em> directory should also go under <em>WebContent</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Unfortunately, Eclipse IDE is infamous for slow indexing of JavaScript files, and given the fact that Ext JS has hundreds of JavaScript files, your work may be interrupted by Eclipse trying to unnecessary re-validate these files. Developers of Sencha Eclipse plugin decided to solve this problem by creating a special type library file (ext.ser) supporting code assistance in Eclipse. This solution will work until some of the Ext JS API changes, after that Sencha should update the type library file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you don&#8217;t have Sencha Eclipse plugin, there is a couple of solutions to this problem (we&#8217;ll use the first one).</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p>Exclude from Eclipse build the following Ext JS directories: ext, build, and packages.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Don&#8217;t copy the Ext JS framework into your Eclipse project. Keep it in the place known for Tomcat, and configure as a loadable module.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To implement the first solution, right click on the properties of your project and select JavaScript | Include Path. Then switch to the Source tab, expand the project&#8217;s Web content and press the buttons Edit and then Add. One by one add the ext, build, and packages as exclusion patterns (add the slash at the end) as shown in <a href="#Fig6-5">[Fig6-5]</a></p>

  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 72. Excluding folders in Eclipse</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For the second solution, you&#8217;ll need to add your Ext JS folder as a static Tomcat module. Double-click at the Tomcat name in the Servers view and then click on the bottom tab Modules. Then Click on Add External Web Module. In the popup window find the folder where your Ext JS is (in my computer it&#8217;s inside the Library folder as in <a href="#Fig6-6">[Fig6-6]</a>) and give it a name (e.g. /extjs-4.2). Now Tomcat will know that on each start it has to load year another static Web module known as /extjs-4.2. If you&#8217;re interested in details of such deployment, open up the file server.xml located in your Eclipse workspace in the hidden directory <em>.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.server.core/tmp0/conf</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To ensure that you did everything right, just enter in your browser the URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/extjs-4.2,">http://localhost:8080/extjs-4.2,</a> and you should see the  welcome screen of Ext JS.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In both of these solutions you&#8217;ll lose the Ext JS context sensitive help, but at least you will eliminate the long pauses caused by Eclipse internal indexing processes. Again, developing ExtJS code in WebStorm IDE or IntelliJ IDEA IDEs would spare you from all these issues because these IDE&#8217;s are smart enough to produce context-sensitive help from an external JavaScript library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this section we brought together three pieces of software: Eclipse IDE, Apache Tomcat server, and Ext JS framework.  Let&#8217;s bring one more program to the mix: Sencha CMD. We already went through the initial code generation of Ext JS applications. If you already have a Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse workspace, run Sencha CMD specifying the <em>WebContent</em> directory of your project as the output folder, where the generated project will reside. For example, if the name of your Dynamic Web Project is hello2, the Sencha CMD command can look as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><em>sencha -sdk /Library/ext-4.2 generate app HelloWorld /Users/yfain11/myEclipseWorkspace/hello2/WebContent</em></p>

  <p>First you need to select the packaging of the Ext JS framework that fits your need. You may select its minimized version to be used in production or a larger and commented version with detailed comments and error messages. Besides, you may select a version of Ext JS that include either all or only the core classes. The third option is to create a custom build of Ext JS that will include only the those framework classes that are used by your application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The file with the minimized production version of Ext JS is called ext-all.js and its size is pretty large: 1.4Mb.

If this application will be used on the high-speed networks and size is not the object, simply add it to your index.html from your local servers or see if Sencha offers the CDN for the Ext JS version you need, which may look similar to the following:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In Chapter 1 we&#8217;ve stated that JavaScript doesn&#8217;t have classes and that constructor functions were the closest to classes language elements. Ext JS extends the JavaScript language and introduces classes and a special way to define and instantiate them with functions <tt>Ext.define()</tt> and <tt>Ext.create()</tt>. Ext JS also allows to extend one class from another using the property <tt>extend</tt> and define class constructors using the property <tt>constructor</tt>.</p>

  <p>Prior to creating a class, Ext JS will run some pre-processors and some post-processors based on the class definition. For example, the class <tt>'SSC.view.Viewport'</tt> from the code sample above uses <tt>extend: 'Ext.container.Viewport'</tt>, which will engage the <em>extend</em> pre-processor that will do some background work to properly build a subclass of extend: <tt>Viewport</tt>.

  <p>One of the interesting pre-processors is <em>xtype</em>, which allows to skip the invocation of the <tt>create()</tt> method for creating the instance of the class. Every Ext JS component has assigned <tt>xtype</tt>. For example, <tt>Ext.panel.Panel</tt> has an <tt>xtype</tt> of <tt>panel</tt>. Online documentation displays the name of the corresponding <tt>xtype</tt> in the header of each component as in <a href="#FIG6-7">Each component has an xtype</a>.</p>

  <p>Most of the above components use the standard Ext JS <tt>xtype</tt> values, so the fact that you have included them into the class <tt>SSC.view.LoginBox</tt> is a command for Ext JS to instantiate all these buttons and text fields.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Object-oriented languages Java and C# can be considered as simpler version of C<tt>. One of the C</tt> features that didn&#8217;t make it into Java and C# was support of multiple inheritance: a class can extend only one other class. This was done for a good reason - debugging of the C++ programs that were written with multiple inheritance was difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Ext JS supports multiple inheritance via JavaScript mixins. A class constructor can get any object as an argument, and Ext JS will use its property values to initialize the corresponding properties defined in the class, if they exist, and the rest of the properties will be created on the fly. The following code snippet shows how to define a <tt>classB</tt> that will have features defined in classes <tt>classA</tt>,<tt>classC</tt>, and <tt>classD</tt>.</p>

  }
  ...
});

WARNING: If more than one mixin has a method with the same name, the first method that was applied to the resulting class wins. To avoid collisions Ext JS allows you to provide fully qualified name of the method, for example `this.mixins.classC.conflictingName(); this.mixins.classD.conflictingName();`.</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>While Ext JS doesn&#8217;t force you to architect your application based on the MVC paradigm, it&#8217;s a really good idea to do so. Earlier in the section on Sencha CMD you&#8217;ve seen how this tool generates a project, which separates model, views, controllers and stores into separate directories as in <a href="#FIG6-1">CMD-generated project</a> that depicted the structure of the Hello World project. But later in this chapter we&#8217;ll build our Save Sick Child application the same way. <a href="#FIG6-8">Model-View-Controller in Ext JS</a> presents a diagram illustration how the Ext JS application that contains all Model-View-Controller tiers.</p>

  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Controller is an object that serves as an intermediary between the data and the views. The data has arrived to your application, and controller has to notify the appropriate view. The user changed the data on the view - the controller should pass the changes to the model (or stores in the Ext JS world). Controller is the place to write event listeners reaction to some important events of your application (e.g. a user clicked on the button). In other words, Controller maps the events to actions to be performed on the data or the view.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>View is a certain portion of the UI that the user sees. The view is populated with the data from the model (or stores).</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Model represents some business entity, e.g. Donor, Campaign, Customer, Order e.t.c. In Ext JS models are access via stores.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Store contains one or more model instances. Typically, a Model is a separate class that is instantiated by the store object, but in simple cases a store can have the model data embedded in its own class. A store may use more than one model if need be. Both stores and model can communicate with the data feed that in a Web application is usually provided by some server-side data feed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When you create a class to be served as a model, it must be a subclass of <tt>Ext.data.Model</tt>. A Model has the <tt>fields</tt> property. For example, this is how the you can represent a Donor entity using just two fields: name and location:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">Ext.define('HR.model.Donor',{

    fields: [
        { name: 'donors',   type: Ext.data.Types.INT },
        { name: 'location', type: Ext.data.Types.STRING}
    ]
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Think of an instance of a model is a of one record representing some business entity, e.g. Donor.  Ext JS generate getters and setters for models, so if an instance of the model is represented by a variable <tt>sscDonor</tt>, you can set or get its value as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">sscDonor.set('name', 'Farata Systems');
var donorName= sscDonor.get('name');</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A store in Ext JS holds a collection of instances of some model. For example, if you the application has retrieved the information about ten donors, it&#8217;ll be represented in Ext JS as a collection of yen instances of the class <tt>Donor</tt>. A custom store in your application has to extend from the class <tt>Ext.data.Store</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you need to quickly create a mock store for testing purposes, you can declare a store with inline data that you can specify using the config option <tt>data</tt>. The next code sample shows a declaration of the store for providing the information about the donors as inline data:</p>

        { name: 'location', type: 'string' }
    ],

    data: [
        { donors: 48, location: 'Chicago, IL' },
        { donors: 60, location: 'New York, NY' },

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>It&#8217;s a good idea to have a mock store with the test data located right on your computer. This way you won&#8217;t depend on the readiness and availability of the server-side data. But usually, a store makes some AJAX call to a server and retrieves the data via the object <tt>Ext.data.reader.Reader</tt> or one of its descendants, for example:</p>

  <h4 id="_component_s_lifecycle">Component&#8217;s Lifecycle</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In previous versions of our Save Sick Chils application CSS was responsible for all layouts of the UI components. In Chapter 11 you&#8217;ll be learning about the <em>responsive design</em> techniques and CSS media queries, which allow to create fluid layouts that automatically adjust to the size of the viewport.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But this section is about Ext JS proprietary way of creating and adding UI components to Web pages. Before the user will see a component, Ext JS framework will go through the following phases for each component:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Load - load the required (or all) Ext JS classes and their dependencies</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Initialize components when the DOM is ready</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Rendering  - convert components to HTML elements</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Layout - measuring and assigning sizes</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Destruction - removing the reference from DOM, removing event listeners and unregistering from the component manager.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Rendering and layout are the most time consuming phases. The rendering does a lot of preparations to give the browser&#8217;s rendering engine HTML elements and not Ext JS classes. The layout phase is slow because the calculation of sizes and positions (unless they are in absolute coordinates) and applying of cascading stylesheets takes time. Ext JS 4.1 was redesigned to minimize the number of reflows, which happen when  the code reads-measures-writes to the DOM and makes dynamic style modifications. Now a large portion or recalculations is done in a batch before modifying the DOM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Each Web page consists of one or more containers, which include some children - components (in Ext JS they are subclasses of <a href="http://bit.ly/Zy3iZU"><tt>Ext.Component</tt></a>), for example, <tt>Ext.button.Button</tt>. If a component can contain other components, it&#8217;s a container (e.g. <tt>Ext.panel.Panel</tt>) and will have <a href="http://bit.ly/13QH0TG"><tt>Ext.container.Container</tt></a> as one of its ancestors. In Ext JS class hierarchy, <tt>Container</tt> is a subclass of <tt>Component</tt>, so all methods and properties defined for a component are available for a container too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You&#8217;ll be defining your container class with as a subclass of a container by including <tt>extend: Ext.container.Container</tt>. The child elements of a container are accessible via its property <tt>items</tt>. In the <tt>Ext.define()</tt> statement of the container you may specify the code that will loop through this <tt>items</tt> array and, say style the components, but actual instances of the children will be provided during the <tt>Ext.create()</tt> call via configuration object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The process of adding a component to a container will typically consist of invoking <tt>Ext.create()</tt> and specifying in a configuration object where to render the component to, for example <tt>renderTo: Ext.getBody()</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But under the hood Ext JS will do a lot more work. The framework will auto-generate a unique ID for the component, assign some event listeners, instantiate component plugins if specified, invoke the <tt>initComponent()</tt>, and add the component to <tt>Ext.ComponentManager</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock">

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_events_2">Events</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Events in Ext JS are defined in the mixin <tt>Ext.util.Observable</tt>. Components interested in receiving events can subscribe to them using on of the following methods:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>By calling the method <tt>addListener()</tt></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>By using the method <tt>on()</tt>.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Declaratively</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The next code snippet shows two different ways of how a combobox can subscribe to the event <tt>change</tt>. The handler function is a callback that will be invoked if the event <tt>change</tt> will be dispatched on this combobox:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">combobox.addListener('change', myEventHandlerFunction);

combobox.on('change', myEventHandlerFunction);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To unsubscribe from the event call the method <tt>removeListener()</tt> or its shorter version <tt>un()</tt>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">combobox.removeListener('change', myEventHandlerFunction);
combobox.un('change', myEventHandlerFunction);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You can also declarativly subscribe to events using <tt>listeners</tt> property of the component:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {
   listeners: {
       click: function() { // handle event here }
   }
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In Chapter 1 you&#8217;ve learned about event bubbling. In Ext JS event bubbling mechanism enables events dispatched by components that include <tt>Ext.util.Observable</tt> bubble up through all enclosing containers. For components it means that you can handle component’s event on container level. It can be handy to subscribe and handle multiple similar events in one place. To enable bubbling for selected events use the <tt>enableBubble()</tt> method, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">this.enableBubble(['textchange', 'validitychange']);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To define custom events use the method <tt>addEvents()</tt>, where you can provide one or more of the custom event names:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">this.addEvents('messagesent', 'updatecompleted');</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For components you have to define custom events inside the <tt>initComponent()</tt> method. For controllers - inside <tt>init()</tt>, and for any other class – inside its constructor.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_layouts">Layouts</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In Ext JS each container has a property <tt>items</tt>, which stores references to its child components. The container&#8217;s property <tt>layout</tt> controls how its children are
laid out inside. If you won&#8217;t explicitly set the <tt>layout</tt> property, its default value is <tt>Auto</tt>, which is just placing components inside the container top to bottom regardless of the component size.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Usually you&#8217;ll be explicitly specifying the layout. For example, the <tt>hbox</tt> layout would arrange all components inside the container horizontally next to each other, but <tt>vbox</tt> layout would arrange them vertically. The <tt>card</tt> layout places the components one under another, but only the top component is visible (think of a tab folder, where the content of only one tab is visible at any given time).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>border</tt> layout is often used to arrange the components in the main viewport (a.k.a. home page) of your application. This layout allows you to split the container&#8217;s real estate into five imaginary regions: <tt>north</tt>, <tt>east</tt>, <tt>west</tt>, <tt>south</tt>, and <tt>center</tt>. If you need to allocate the top menu items, place them to the region <tt>north</tt>. The footer of the page is in the <tt>south</tt> as shown in the code sample below.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">Ext.define('MyApp.view.Viewport', {
  extend: 'Ext.container.Viewport',

  layout: 'border',

  items: [{
    width: 980,
    height: 200,
    title: "Top Menu",
    region: "north",
    xtype:  "panel"},
   {
    width: 980,
    height: 600,
    title: "Page Content",
    region: "center",
    xtype:  "panel"},
   },
   {
    width: 980,
    height: 100,
    title: "The footer",
    region: "south",
    xtype:  "panel"},
   }]
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
  <h5 id="_the_flex_property">The flex Property</h5>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Ext JS has a property <tt>flex</tt> that allows make your layout more flexible. Instead of specifying the width or height of a child component in absolute values you can split the available space proportionally. For example if the space has to be divided between two components having the <tt>flex</tt> values 2 and 1, this means that the 2/3 of the container&#8217;s space will be allocated to the first component, and 1/3 to the second one as illustrated in the following code snippet.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript"> layout: 'vbox',

 items: [{
   xtype: 'component',
   html: 'Lorem ipsum dolor',
   flex: 2
   },
   {
   xtype: 'button',
   action: 'showform',
   text: 'DONATE NOW',
   flex: 1
 }]</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Tip: the format of this book doesn&#8217;t allow us to include detailed description of major Ext JS component. If you are planning to use Ext JS for development of enterprise Web applications, allocate some extra time to learn the data grid <tt>Ext.grid.Panel</tt> that&#8217;s used for rendering of tabular data. You should also master working with forms with <tt>Ext.form.Panel</tt>.</p>

  <p>In this section we&#8217;ll do a code walk-through of the Ext JS version of our Save Sick Child application. We&#8217;ve prepared two separate Eclipse projects SSC_Top_ExJS.zip contains the top portion of the application, and SSC_Complete_ExtJS.zip contains the complete version. To test these applications in Eclipse, you need to have it configured with Tomcat as described earlier in the section "Configuring Eclipse project with Apache Tomcat and Ext JS".</p>

  <p>Then select Eclipse menu File | Import | General | Existing projects into workspace and press the button Next. Then select the option Select archive file and press browse to find SSC_Top_ExJS.zip on your disk. This will import the entire Dynamic Web Project, and most likely you&#8217;ll see one error in the Problems view indicating that the target runtime with so-and-so name is not defined. This may happen because the name of the Tomcat configuration in your Eclipse is different from the one in the file SSC_Top_ExJS.zip.</p>

Right-click on the server name in the Servers view and select Add and Remove menu item. You&#8217;ll see a popup window similar to <a href="#FIG6-1-SSC">Deploying Dynamic Web Project</a>, which depicts a state when the project SSC_Top_ExtJS is deployed, but SSC_Complete_ExtJS.</p>

Even though there are three columns in this layout, the entire content on this page is located in the middle column having the width of 980.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html">SASS</a> is an extension of CSS3, which allows using variables, mixins, inline imports, inherit selectors and more with CSS-compatible syntax.  The simplest example of SASS syntax is to define a variable that stores some color code, e.g. <tt>$mypanel-color: #cf6cc2;</tt>. Now if you need to change the color you just change the value of the variable in one place rather than trying to find all places in a regular CSS where this color was used. But since modern Web browsers don&#8217;t understand SASS styles, they have to be converted into regular CSS before deploying your Web applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Ext JS includes <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, which is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework built on top of SASS. It includes a number of modules and functions that will save your time for defining such things as border radius, gradients, transitions and more in a cross-browser fashion. For example, you write one SASS line <tt>.simple   { @include border-radius(4px, 4px); }</tt>, but Compass will generate the following cross-browser CSS section:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html"> -webkit-border-radius: 4px 4px;
 -moz-border-radius: 4px / 4px;
 -khtml-border-radius: 4px / 4px;
 border-radius: 4px / 4px; }</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>See <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/border_radius/">Compass documentation</a> for more examples like the above. To manually compile your SASS into CSS you can use the command <em>compass compile</em> from the Command or Terminal window. This step is also performed automatically during the Sencha CMD application build. In case of the Save Sick Child application the resulting CSS file is located in build/SSC/production/resources/SSC-all.css.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We are not using any extended CSS syntax in our Save Sick Child application, but since SASS is a superset of CSS, you can use your existing CSS as is - just save it in the <em>.scss</em> file. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about the SASS syntax, visit the site <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass-lang.com</a>, which has tutorials and reference documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In general, Ext JS substantially reduces the need for manual CSS writing by using predefined <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.0/!/guide/theming">themes</a>. Sencha offers a <a href="http://www.sencha.com/learn/theming/!/guide/theming-section-1">tutorial</a> explaining how to use SASS and Compass for theming.</p>

These numbers would be better if instead of ext-all.js we&#8217;d be linking ext.js, and even better if we&#8217;d created a custom build (see Sencha CMB section above) for the Save Sick Child application merging the application code into one file to contain only those framework classes that were actually used.</p>

  <p>In this section we&#8217;ll review the code supporting the lower half of the Save Sick Child UI, which you should import into Eclipse IDE from the file SSC_Complete_ExtJS.zip. If you see the target runtime error, read the beginning of the section "Save Sick Child: The Top Portion" for the cure. Stop the Tomcat server if running, and deploy the SSC_Complete_ExtJS under Tomcat server in the Servers view (the right-click menu, Add and Remove&#8230;).  Start Tomcat in Eclipse, right-click on the project and run it on the server. It&#8217;ll open up a Web browser pointing at <a href="http://localhost:8080/SSC_Complete_ExtJS">http://localhost:8080/SSC_Complete_ExtJS</a> showing the window similar to the one depicted on <a href="#FIG6-8-SSC">Save Sick Child with live charts</a>.</p>

  <p>This version has some additions comparing to the previous ones. Notice the bottom left panel with charts. First of all, the charts are placed inside the panel with tabs: Charts and Table. The same data can be rendered either as a chart or as a grid. Second, the charts became live thanks to ExtJS. We took snapshot of the Window shown in <a href="#FIG6-8-SSC">Save Sick Child with live charts</a> while hovering the mouse over the pie slice representing New York, and the slice has extended from the pie showing a tooltip.</p>

  <p>The SSC_Complete_ExtJS has more Ext JS classes comparing to SSC_Top_ExtJS.  You can see more views on <a href="#FIG6-9-SSC">JavaScript classes of SSC_Complete_ExtJS</a>. Besides, we&#8217;ve added two classes Donors.js and Campaigns.js to serve as data stores for the panels with charts and maps.</p>

  <p>The bottom portion of the Windows includes several components. The video view simply reuses the HTML &lt;video&gt; tag we used in chapters 4 and 5. Ext JS 4.2 doesn&#8217;t offer any other solutions for embedding videos. On one hand, subclussing <tt>Ext.Component</tt> is the lightest way of including any arbitrary HTML markup. On the other hand, turning HTML into an Ext JS component allows us to use it the same way as any other Ext JS component, e.g. participate in layouts. Here&#8217;s the code of the VideoPanel.js:</p>

      <p> Since we&#8217;ve added video container just by including the HTML <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt> component, Ext JS wouldn&#8217;t create an ID for it.

In this case such key-value pair is <tt>mapContainer: 'div'</tt>.

  <p>Authors of this book work for the company called Farata Systems, which has developed an open source freely available software Clear Toolkit for Ext JS, and the code generator and Eclipse IDE plugin CDB comes with it. CDB is a productivity tool that was created specifically for the applications that need to retrieve, manipulate, and save the data in some persistent storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Such applications are known as <em>CRUD applications</em> because they perform Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete operations with data. If the server side of your Web application is developed in Java, with CDB you can easily generate a CRUD application, where Ext JS front end communicates the Java back end. In this section you will learn how jump start development of such CRUD Web applications.</p>

  <p>Name the new project <tt>episode_1_intro</tt>. CDB supports different ways of linking the Ext JS framework to the application. CDB automatically copies the Ext JS framework under the Web server (Apache Tomcat in our case). We&#8217;re going to use this local Ext JS URL, but you can specify any folder in your machine and CDB will copy the Ext JS file from there into your project. You can also  use Ext JS from the Sencha&#8217;s CDN, if you don&#8217;t want to store these libraries inside your project. Besides, using a common CDN will allow Web browser to reuse the cached version of Ext JS.</p>

  <p>For this project we are not going to use any server-side persistence frameworks like MyBatis or Hibernate. Just click the button Finish, and you&#8217;ll see some some initial CDB messages on the Eclipse console. When CDB runs for the first time it creates in your project&#8217;s <tt>WebContent</tt> folder the directory structure recommended by Sencha for MVC applications.  It also generates <tt>index.html</tt> for this application, which contains the link to the entry point of our Ext JS application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>CDB generates an empty project with one sample controller and one view - <tt>Viewport.js</tt>. To run this application, you need to add the newly generated Dynamic Web Project to Tomcat and start the server (right-click on the Tomcat in the Servers view of Eclipse IDE).</p>

  <h4 id="_part_two_generating_a_crud_application">Part Two: Generating a CRUD application</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Part Two of the CDB section covers the process of creation of a simple CRUD application that uses Ext JS and Java. We&#8217;ll go through the following steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Create a plain old Java object (POJO) and the corresponding <tt>Ext.data.Model</tt></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Create a Java service and populate <tt>Ext.data.Store</tt> with data from service</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Use the auto-generated Ext JS application</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Extend the auto-generated CRUD methods</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Use <tt>ChangeObject</tt> to track the data changes</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now let&#8217;s use CDB to create a CRUD application. You&#8217;ll learn how turn a POJO into an Ext JS model, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>how to populate the Ext JS store from a remote service</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>how to use automatically generated UI for that application</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>how to extend the UI</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>what the <tt>ChangeObject</tt> class is for</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>First, we&#8217;ll extend the application from Part One - the CRUD application needs a Java POJO.  To start, create a Java class <tt>Person</tt> in the package <tt>dto</tt>. Then add to this class the properties (as well as getters and setters) <tt>firstName</tt>, <tt>lastName</tt>, <tt>address</tt>, <tt>ssn</tt> and <tt>phone</tt> and <tt>id</tt>. Add the class  constructor that initializes these properties as shown in the code listing below.</p>
</div>
<div id="LISTING_1" class="listingblock">
  <div class="title">Person data transfer object</div>
  <div class="content monospaced">

public class Person {

  @JSGeneratedId
  private Integer id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private String phone;
  private String ssn;

  public Person(Integer id, String firstName, String lastName,
                                    String phone, String ssn) {
  	super();
  	this.id = id;
  	this.firstName = firstName;
  	this.lastName = lastName;
  	this.phone = phone;
  	this.ssn = ssn;
  }

  // Getters and Setters are omitted for brevity
}
</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You may also add a <tt>toString()</tt> method to the class. Now you&#8217;ll need the same corresponding Ext JS model for  the Java class <tt>Person</tt>. Just annotate this class with the annotation <tt>@JSClass</tt> to have CDB generate the Ext JS model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The next step is to annotate the <tt>id</tt> field with the CDB annotation <tt>@JSGeneratedId</tt>. This annotation  instructs CDB to threat this field as an auto generated id. Let&#8217;s examine the directory of Ext JS MVC application to see what&#8217;s inside the model folder. In the JavaScript section there is the folder dto which corresponds to the Java <tt>dto</tt> package where the <tt>PersonModel</tt> resides as illustrated on <a href="#FIG6-5-CDB">Generated from Java class Ext JS model</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Clear Data Builder generated two files as recommended by the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/dslCatalog/generationGap.html">Generation Gap pattern</a>, which is about keeping the generated and handwritten parts separate by putting them in different classes linked by inheritance. Let&#8217;s open the person model. In our case the <tt>PersonModel.js</tt> is extended from the generated <tt>_PersonModel.js</tt>. Should we need to customize this class, we&#8217;ll do it inside the <tt>Person.js</tt>, but this underscore-prefixed file will be regenerated each and every time when we change something in our model. CDB follows this pattern for all generated artifacts - Java services, Ext JS models and stores. This model contains all the fields from our Person DTO.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now we need to create a Java service to populate the Ext JS store with the data. Let&#8217;s create a Java  interface <tt>PersonService</tt> in the package <tt>service</tt>.

  <p>To have CDB to expose this service as a remote object, we&#8217;ll use the annotation called <tt>@JSService</tt>.  Another annotation <tt>@JSGenetareStore</tt> will instruct CDB to generate the store. In this case CDB will create the <em>destination-aware store</em>. This means that store will know from where to populate its content. All configurations of the store&#8217;s proxies will be handled by the code generator. With <tt>@JSFillMethod</tt> annotation we will identify our main read method (the "R" from CRUD).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Also it would be nice to have some sort of a sample UI to test the service - the annotation <tt>@JSGenerateSample</tt> will help here. CDB will examine the interface <tt>PersonService</tt>, and based on these annotations will generate all Ext JS MVC artifacts (models, views, controller) and the sample application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To test the rest of the CRUD methods, we&#8217;ll ask the user to insert one new row, modify three existing ones and remove two rows using the generated Web client.

  <p>The corresponding Java implementation of <tt>ChangeObject</tt> is available on the server side and Clear Toolkit passes <tt>ChangeObject</tt> instances to the appropriate <tt>do*</tt> method of the service class. Take a look at the <tt>getPersons_doCreate()</tt> method from <a href="#LISTING_3">Implementation of PersonService interface</a>. When the server needs to read the new or updated data arrived from the client your Java class has to invoke the method <tt>changeObject.getNewVersion()</tt>. This method will return the JSON object that you need to deserialize into the object <tt>Person</tt>. This is done in <a href="#LISTING_3">Implementation of PersonService interface</a> and looks like this.</p>

  <p>When the new version of the <tt>Person</tt> object is extracted from the <tt>ChangeObject</tt> you can do with it whatever has to be done to persist it in the appropriate storage. In our example we just print the new person information on the server-side Java console. This is why we said earlier, that it may be a good idea to provide a pretty printing feature on the class <tt>Person</tt> by overriding method <tt>toString()</tt>. Similarly, when you need to do a delete, the <tt>changeObject.getPrevVersion()</tt> would give you a person to be deleted.</p>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_part_three_data_pagination">Part Three: Data Pagination</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The pagination feature is needed in almost every enterprise web application. Often you don&#8217;t want to bring all the  data to the client at once - a page by page feed brings the data to the user a lot faster. The user can navigate back and forth between the pages using pagination UI components. To do that, we need to split our data on the server side into chunks, to send them page by page by the client request. Implementing pagination is the agenda for this section. We&#8217;ll do the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Add the data pagination to our sample CRUD application:</p>
      
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Add the <tt>Ext.toolbar.Paging</tt> component</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Bind both <em>grid</em> and <em>pagingtoolbar</em> to the same store</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Use <tt>DirectOptions</tt> class to read the pagination parameters</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>

      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We are going to improve our CRUD application by adding the paging toolbar component bound to the same store as the grid. The class <tt>DirectOptions</tt> will handle the pagination parameters on the server side.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>So far CDB has generate the UI from the Java back end service as well as the Ext JS store and model. We&#8217;ll refactor the service code from previous example to generate more data (a thousand objects) so we have something to paginate, see below.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To shorten the development cycle of your Web application you need to start testing it on the early stages of the project. It seems obvious, but many enterprise IT organizations haven&#8217;t adopted agile testing methodologies, which costs them dearly. JavaScript is dynamically typed interpreted language, which means that there is no compiler to help in  identifying errors as it&#8217;s done in compiled languages like Java. This means that a lot more time should be allocated for testing for JavaScript Web applications. Moreover, a programmer who didn&#8217;t introduce testing techniques into his daily routine can&#8217;t be 100% sure that his code works properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The static code analysis and code quality tools such as <a href="http://esprima.org/">Esprima</a> and <a href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a> will help in reducing the number of syntax errors and improve quality of your code. Later in this chapter we will demonstrate how to setup <tt>JSHint</tt> for your JavaScript project and automate the process of checking your code for the syntax errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To switch to a test-driven development mode, make testing a part of your development process in its early stages rather than scheduling testing after the development cycle is complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Introduction of test-driven development may substantially improve your code quality. It is very important to receive the feedback about your code on a regular basis. That&#8217;s why tests must be automated and should run as soon as you&#8217;ve changed the code. In this chapter we are going to introduce Grunt - the task runner tool - that can help you with automation of repetitive operations like running tests when the code changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There are many testing frameworks in JavaScript world, but we&#8217;ll give you a brief overview of two of them: <a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a> and <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>. The main goal of each framework is to test small pieces of code a.k.a. <em>units</em>.  You&#8217;ll learn how to make your JavaScript project lifecycle independent from any specific frameworks or libraries using Grunt tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We will go through basic testing techniques known as "Test-Driven Development" and "Test First". You&#8217;ll learn how to automate the testing process in multiple browsers with <a href="https://github.com/airportyh/testem">Testem Runner</a> or by running tests in so called <em>headless</em> mode with <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>. You&#8217;ll learn how to mock and stub selected artifacts of the environment (such as <tt>XMLHTTPRequiest</tt> object or a timer) with <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon.js</a> and how to unit test the DOM manipulation code.</p>

  <h3 id="_why_testing">Why Testing</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Any software has bugs. But in interpreted languages like JavaScript you don&#8217;t have help of compilers that could have pointed you at the potential issues on early stages of development. You need to continue testing code over and over again to catch regression errors, to be able to add new features without breaking the existing ones. The code covered with tests is easy to refactor. Tests help to prove correctness of your code. A well tested code leads to better overall design of your programs.</p>

  <h3 id="_testing_basics">Testing Basics</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this chapter we are going to discuss the following types of testing (we don&#8217;t cover QA and UAT in this book):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Unit tests</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Integration tests</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Functional tests</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Load (a.k.a. stress) tests</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s go over the strategies, approaches, and tools that will help you in automation of each of the above tests.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_unit_testing">Unit Testing</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <em>unit test</em> is a piece of code that invokes a method being tested. It <em>asserts</em> some assumptions about the application logic and behavior of the  method. Typically you&#8217;ll be writing such tests using unit-testing framework of your choice. Tests should run fast, be automated with clear output. For example you can test if a function is called with particular arguments, it should return expected result.
We will take a closer look on unit testing terminology and vocabulary in a <a href="#TDD">[TDD]</a> section.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_integration_testing">Integration Testing</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Integration testing is a phase when already tested units are combined into a module to test the interfaces between them. You may want to test the integration of your code with the code written by other developers, e.g. some third-party framework. Integration tests ensure that any abstraction layers we build over the third-party code work as expected. Both unit and integration tests are written by application developers.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_functional_testing">Functional Testing</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Functional testing (or user acceptance testing) is aimed at finding out whether the application properly implements business logic. For example, if the user clicks on a row in the grid with customers, the program should display a form view with specific details about the selected customer. In functional testing business users should define what has to be tested, unlike unit or integration testing where tests are created by software developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Functional tests can be performed manually by a real person clicking through each and every view of the web application confirming that it operates properly or reporting discrepancies with the functional specifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But there are tools to automate the process of functional testing of Web applications. Such tools allow to record the users' actions and replay them in the automatic mode. Below are brief descriptions of two of such tools - Selenium and CasperJS.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium </a></p>
      
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Selenium is an advanced browser automation tool suite that has capabilities to run and record user scenarios without requiring developers to learn any scripting languages. Also Selenium has an API for integration with many programming languages like Java, C# and etc. Selenium uses the WebDriver API to talk to the browsers and receive running context information. WebDriver is becoming <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/default/webdriver-spec.html">the standard API for browser automation</a>. Selenium supports a wide range of <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/about/platforms.jsp">browsers and platforms</a>.</p>
</div>

      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://casperjs.org/quickstart.html">Casper.js</a></p>
      
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>CasperJS is a scripting framework written in JavaScript. CasperJS allows to create interaction scenarios like defining and ordering the navigation steps, filling and submitting forms or even scrapping Web content and making Web page screenshots. CasperJS works on top of PhantomJS browser, which limits he testing runtime environment to WebKit-based browsers only. Still it&#8217;s a very useful tool when you want to run tests in a Continuous Integration (CI)environment. You can read more about <a href="#WHAT_IS_PHANTOMJS">PhantomJS</a> and <a href="#WHAT_IS_CI">CI</a> later in the corresponding sidebars later in this chapter.</p>
</div>

      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="WHAT_IS_PHANTOMJS" class="sidebarblock">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="title">What is PhantomJS?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>PhantomJS is a headless WebKit-based rendering engine with JavaScript API.  Think of PhantomJS as a browser that doesn&#8217;t have any graphical user interface. PhantomJS can execute HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Because PhantomJS is not required to render GUI, it can be used in display-less environments (e.g. CI server) to run tests. In our case, Grunt automatically spawns PhantomJS instance, executes the code of our tests, reads the execution results using PhantomJS API, and prints them out in the console.</p>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_load_testing">Load Testing</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Load testing is a process that can help in answering the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>How many concurrent users can work with your application without bringing your server to its knees?</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Even if your server is capable of serving a thousand users, is your application performance in a compliance with the Service Level Agreement (SLA), if any?</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>It all comes down to two factors: availability and response time of your application. Ideally, these requirements should be well defined in the SLA document, which should clearly state what metrics are acceptable from the user&#8217;s perspective. For example, the SLA can include a clause stating that the initial download of your application shouldn&#8217;t take longer than 10 seconds for users with a slow connections (under 1Mbps). SLA can also state that the query to display a list of customers shouldn&#8217;t run for more than five seconds, and the application should be operational 99.9 percent of the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To avoid surprises after going live with your new mission-critical web application, don&#8217;t forget to include in your project plan an item to create and run a set of heavy stress tests. Do this well in advance before your project goes live. You don&#8217;t need to hire a thousand of interns to play the roles of concurrent users to find out whether your application will meet the SLA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Automated load testing software allows you to emulate required number of users, set up the throttling to emulate a slower connection, and configure the ramp-up speed. For example, you can simulate a situation where the number of users logged on to your system grows at the speed of 50 users every 10 seconds. Stress testing software also allows you to pre-record the users interactions, and then you can run these scripts emulating a heavy load.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Professional stress-testing software allows simulating the load close to the real-world usage patterns. You should be able to create and run mixed scripts simulating a situation in which some users are logging on to your application while others are retrieving the data and performing data modifications. Below are some tools worth considering for load testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Apache Benchmark is a simple to use command line tool. For example, with a command <tt>ab -n 10 -c 10 -t 60 http://savesickchild.org:8080/ssc_extjs/</tt> Apache Benchmark will open 10 concurrent connection with the server and will send 10 requests via each connection to simulate 10 visitors working with your Web application during 60 seconds. The number of concurrent connections is the actual number of concurrent users. You can find an Apache Benchmark sample report in <a href="#AB_REPORT">following snippet</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="TDD">Test Driven Development</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The methodology known as Test-Driven Development (TDD) substantially changes the way a traditional software development is done. This methodology wants you to write tests <em>even before</em> writing the application code. Instead of just using testing to verify our work <em>after it&#8217;s done</em>, TDD moves the testing into the earlier application design phase. You should use the tests to clarify your ideas about what you are about to program. Here is fundamental mantra of TDD:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Write a test and make it fail.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Make the test pass.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Refactor.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Repeat.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This technique also referred as "Red-Green-Refactoring" because IDE&#8217;s and test runners use red color to indicate failed tests and green color to indicate the tests that passed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When you are about to start programming a class with some business logic, ask yourself, "How can I ensure that this function works as expected?" After you know the answer, write a test JavaScript class that calls this function <em>to assert</em> that the business logic gives the expected result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>An assertion is a true-false statement that represents what a programmer assumes about program state, e.g.  <strong>customerID &gt;0</strong> is an assertion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>According to <a href="#fowler"><em>Martin Fowler</em></a>, an assertion is a section of code that works only if certain conditions are true. An assertion is a conditional statement that is assumed to be always true. Failure of an assertion results in test failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Run your test, and it will immediately fail because no application code is written yet! Only after the test is written, start programming the business logic of your application</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You should write a simplest possible piece of code to make the test pass. Don&#8217;t try to find a generic solution at this step. For example, if you want to test a calculator that needs to return <tt>4</tt> as result of <tt>2+2</tt> write the code what simply returns <tt>4</tt>. Don&#8217;t worry about the performance or optimization at this point in time. Just make the test pass. Once you made it, you can refactor your application code to make it more efficient. Now you might want to introduce a real algorithm for implementing the application logic without worrying about breaking the  contract with other components of your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A failed unit test indicates that your code change introduced regression, which is a new bug in a previously worked software. Automated testing and well-written test cases can reduce the likelihood of a regression in your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>TDD allows to receive feedback from your code almost immediately. It&#8217;s better to find that something is broken during development rather than in the application deployed in production.</p>

  <p>In addition to business logic, web applications should be tested for proper rendering of UI components, changing view states, dispatching, and handling events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>With any testing framework, your tests will follow same basic pattern. First, you need to setup up the test environment. Second, you run the  production code and check that it works as it supposed to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Finally, you need to clean up after the test will run - remove everything that your program has created during setup of the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a id="AAAR"></a>This pattern for authoring unit tests is called <em>Arrange-Act-Assert</em> (AAA <span class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the <em>Arrange</em> phase you set up the unit of work to test. For example, create a DOM element.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the <em>Act</em> phase you exercise the unit under test and capture the  resulting state. You execute your production code in unit test context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the <em>Assert</em> phase you verify the behavior through assertions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There is one more phase: <em>Reset</em>. In this phase, if needed, you reset the environment to the initial state. For example, erase the DOM elements created in the <em>Arrange</em> phase.</p>

  <h4 id="_automate_everything">Automate Everything</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You should automate testing as much as you can to reduce the cost of building, deploying, and maintaining your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now lets start building the foundation for our refactored application. We are going to use the tasks running framework for the JavaScript project called <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>. With Grunt&#8217;s help we&#8217;ll automate process of running tests once the code changes. The tests should help in assessing the quality of our code. You&#8217;ll learn how to setup Grunt to watch your code changes and run tests right after you modified the code and saved the changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>With the Grunt tool you can have a script to run all your tests. If you came from the Java world, you know about Apache Ant, a general-purpose command-line tool to drive processes described in <em>build files</em> as <em>targets</em>. Grunt also running the tasks described in scripts. There is a wide range of tasks available today - starting with running automated unit tests and ending with JavaScript code minification. Grunt provides a separate layer of abstraction where you can define tasks in special DSL (domain-specific language) in Gruntfile for execution.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Node.js (or simply Node) is a server-side JavaScript framework. Node uses V8, the JavaScript engine by Google used in Chrome/Chromium. The V8 engine provides JavaScript API for accessing the file system, sockets and  running processes. The Grunt tool is built on top of Node JavaScript APIs. You can find more information about Node.js at  <a href="http://nodejs.org/about/">their website</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Node Package Manager (NPM) is a utility as well as <a href="https://npmjs.org/">community repository</a> for open source JavaScript projects.

  <p>Now after covering the basics of Grunt tool we can use it for something more interesting than just printing "<em>hello world</em>" on the screen. Since JavaScript is a interpreted language there is no compiler to help catch syntax errors. But you can use <a href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a>, an open source tool, which helps with identifying errors in JavaScript code in lieu of compiler. Consider the following JavaScript <a href="#LISTING_WITH_ERRORS">code</a>.</p>

  <p>In JavaScript, you can omit a semicolon between two statements written in separate lines. Automatic semicolon insertion is a source code parsing procedure that infers omitted semicolons in certain contexts into your program.

QUnit now runs completely standalone and doesn&#8217;t have any jQuery dependencies.

  <h4 id="_behavior_driven_development_with_jasmine">Behavior-Driven Development With Jasmine</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The idea behind <em>behavior-driven development</em> (BDD) is to use the natural language constructs to describe what you think your code should be doing or more specifically, what your functions should be returning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Similarly to unit tests, with BDD you write short specifications that test one feature at a time. Specifications should be sentences. For example, "Calculator adds two positive numbers". Such sentences will help you to easy identify the failed test by simply reading this sentence in the resulting report. Now we&#8217;ll demonstrate this concept using Jasmine - the BDD frameworks for JavaScript. Jasmine provides a very nice way to group, execute, and report JavaScript unit tests.</p>

  <p>Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, which results in multiple integrations per day.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Introduced by Martin Fowler and Matthew Foemmel, the theory of continuous integration <span class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</span> recommends creating scripts and running automated builds (including tests) of your application at least once a day.
This allows you to identify issues in the code early.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Authors of this book successfully use an open source framework called <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> (there are other similar CI servers) for establishing continuous build process.</p>

  <p>With Jenkins, you can have scripts that run either at a specified time interval or on each source code repository check-in of the new code. You may also force an additional build process whenever you like. The Grunt command line tool should be installed and be available on CI machine to allow the Jenkins server invoke Grunt scrips and publish test results.</p>

  <p>After we&#8217;ve set up the tools for running tests, let&#8217;s start developing tests and learn the Jasmine framework constructs. Every specification file has a set of <em>suites</em> defined in the <tt>describe</tt> function. Suites help logically organize code of test specifications.</p>

<div class="colist arabic">
  
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>
      <p>The function <tt>describe()</tt> accepts two parameters - the name of the test suite, and the callback function. The function is a block of code that implements the suite. If for some reasons you would like to skip the suite from execution you can just use method <tt>xdescribe()</tt> and a whole suite will be excluded until you rename it back to <tt>describe()</tt>.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The function <tt>it()</tt> also accepts similar parameters - the name of the test specification, and the function that implements this specification. Like in case with suites, Jasmine has a corresponding <tt>xit</tt> method to exclude specification from execution.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Each suite can have any number of nested suites.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Each suite can have any number of specifications.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The code checks to see if <tt>2+2</tt> equals <tt>4</tt>. We used the function <tt>toEqual()</tt>, which is a <em>matcher</em>. Define expectations with the function <tt>expect()</tt>, which takes a value, called the actual. It&#8217;s chained with a matcher function, which takes the expected value (in our case it&#8217;s 4) and checks if it satisfies the criterion defined in the matcher. Various flavors of matchers are shipped with Jasmine framework, and we&#8217;re going to review a couple the frequently used matchers functions.</p>

  <p>Above we&#8217;ve listed only some of existing matchers. You can find the complete documentation with code examples at <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/#section-Matchers">official Jasmine website</a> and at <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Matchers">wiki</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="_specification_setup">Specification Setup</h5>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Jasmine framework has an API to arrange your specification (see <a href="#AAAR">[AAAR]</a>). It includes two methods - <tt>beforeEach()</tt> and <tt>afterEach()</tt>, which allow you to execute some code before and after each spec respectively. It&#8217;s very useful for instantiation of the shared objects or cleaning up after the tests complete.
If you need to fulfill your test with some common dependencies or setup the environment, just place code inside <tt>beforeEach()</tt> method. Such dependencies and environment are known as <em>fixture</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
  <div class="content">
    
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><strong>What is Fixture?</strong>
Test fixture refers to the fixed state used as a baseline for running tests. The main purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. Sometimes a fixture also referred as <em>test context</em>.</p>

  <h4 id="_testing_dom">Testing DOM</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Document Object Model is a standard browser API that allows a developer to access and manipulate page elements. Pretty often your JavaScript code needs to access and manipulate the HTML page elements in some way. Testing DOM is the crucial part of testing your client side JavaScript.
By design, the DOM standard defines a browser-agnostic API. But in the real world, if you want to make sure that your code works in the particular browser you need to run the test inside this browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Earlier in this chapter we&#8217;ve introduced the Jasmine method <tt>beforeEach()</tt>, which is the right place for setting all required DOM elements and making them available in the specifications.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIX-1" class="listingblock">
  <div class="title">Using jQuery APIs to create the required DOM elements before run the spec</div>
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">describe("spec", function() {
    var usernameInput;
    beforeEach(function() { // <b>&lt;1&gt;</b>
        usernameInput = $(document.createElement("input")).attr({ // <b>&lt;2&gt;</b>
            type: 'text',
            id: 'username',
            name: 'username'
        })[0];
    });
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
  
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>
      <p>Inside the <tt>beforeEach()</tt> method we&#8217;re using the API to manipulate the DOM programatically. Also, if you&#8217;re using an HTML test runner you can add the fixture using HTML tags. But we don&#8217;t recommend this approach because pretty soon you will find that the test runner will become unmaintainable and clogged with tons of fixture HTML code.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Create an <tt>&lt;input&gt;</tt> element using jQuery APIs, which will turn into the following HTML:</p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The jQuery selectors API is more convenient for working with DOM than a standard JavaScript DOM API. But in the future examples we will use the <a href="https://github.com/searls/jasmine-fixture">jasmine-fixture</a> library for easier setup of the DOM fixture. Jasmine-fixture uses similar to jQuery selectors syntax for injecting HTML fixtures. With this library you will significantly decrease the amount of repetitive code while creating the fixtures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s see how the example from <a href="#FIX-1">previous code snippet</a> looks like with the jasmine-fixture library.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  <div class="title">Using jasmine-fixture to setup the DOM before spec run</div>
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">describe("spec", function() {
    var usernameInput;

    });

    it("should not allow login with empty username and password and return code equals 0", function() {
        var result = ssc.login(usernameInput, passwordInput); // <b>&lt;2&gt;</b>
        expect(result).toBe(0);
    });
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
  
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>
      <p>Using the <tt>affix()</tt> function provided by the <em>jasmine-fixture</em> library and expressiveness of CSS selectors we can easily setup required DOM elements. More examples of possible selectors could be found at the <a href="https://github.com/searls/jasmine-fixture#more-examples">documentation page</a> of jasmine-fixture.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Now when all requirements for our production code (<tt>login()</tt> function) are satisfied we can run it in the context of a test and assert the results.</p>
    </li>
  
  </ol>
  
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>As you can see, testing of the DOM manipulation code is much like any other type of unit testing. You need to prepare a fixture (a.k.a. the testing context), run the production code and assert the results.</p>

Since Grunt is a command line tool, you can use a general launching feature of the WebStorm IDE and configure it as an <em>External Tool</em>. Open the WebStorm preferences and navigate to <em>External Tools</em> section to get access to the external tools configuration as in <a href="#FIG_SO_AND_SO">[FIG_SO_AND_SO]</a>.</p>

    <li>
      <p>Also you need to specify the <em>Working Directory</em> to run the Grunt tool. In our case, grunt configuration file is located in the root of our project.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Testing is one of the most important processes of software development. Well organized testing helps keeping the code in a good and working state. It&#8217;s especially important in interpreted languages like JavaSctipt where there is no compiler to provide a helping hand to find lots of errors on very early stages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this situation, static code analysis tools, like JSHint, could become very handy in helping with identifying typos and enforcing best practices accepted by the JavaScript community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In enterprise projects developed with compiled languages people often debate if test-driven development is really beneficial. With JavaScript it&#8217;s non-debatable unless you have unlimited time and budget and are ready to live with unmaintainable JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The enterprises that have adopted test-driven development (as well as behavior-driven development) routines make the application development process safer by including test scripts in the continuous integration build process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Automating unit tests reduces the number of bugs and decreases the amount of time developers need to spend manually testing their code. If automatically launched test scripts (unit, integration, functional, and load testing) don&#8217;t reveal any issues, you can rest assured that the latest code changes did not break the application logic, and that the application performs according to SLA.</p>

  <h2 id="_upgrading_http_to_websocket">Upgrading HTTP to WebSocket</h2>
  
  <div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This chapter is about upgrading from the HTTP protocol to a more responsive HTML5 WebSocket. It starts with a brief overview of the existing legacy Web networking, and then you&#8217;ll learn why and how to use HTML5&#8217;s Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The new version of our Save Sick Child application will include the online auction utilizing WebSocket, and you&#8217;ll see an example of using Server-Sent Events for broadcasting the up-to-the-minute donation information. The goal is to let you see the advantages of changing the way of client-server communications on the Web. You&#8217;ll clearly see the advantages of WebSocket over a regular HTTP by monitoring the network traffic with such tools as Wireshark and Google Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>All the server-side functionality supporting this chapter is written in Java, using Java API for WebSocket <a href="http://java.net/projects/tyrus">reference implementation</a>, which will be the part of upcoming Java EE 7 specification. We are using the <a href="http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/4.0/promoted/">latest available build of the Glassfish Application Server</a>. If you don&#8217;t know Java, just treat this server-side setup as a service that supports WebSocket protocol. For Java developers interested in diving into the server-side, we&#8217;ll provide the source code and brief comments as a part of the code samples that come with this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We&#8217;ll show and compare the server-side data push done with Server-Sent Events and WebSocket. Also you&#8217;ll see a brief overview of popular existing frameworks that can streamline your WebSocket application development.</p>

  <h3 id="_near_real_time_applications_with_http">Near Real Time Applications With HTTP</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The HTTP protocol is the lingua franca of today&#8217;s Web  applications, where client-server communications are based on the request-response paradigm. On the low level, Web browsers establish a TCP/IP connection for each HTTP session. Currently there are 3 basic options that developers use for the browser-server communication: polling, long polling, and streaming. These options are hacks on the top of a half-duplex (a one way street) HTTP protocol to simulate real-time behavior. By <em>real-time</em> we mean the ability to react to some event as it happens. Lets discuss each of them.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_polling">Polling</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>With <em>polling</em>, your client code sends requests to the server after based on some pre-configured interval (e.g. using JavaScript <tt>setInterval()</tt> function). Some of the server&#8217;s responses will be empty, if the requested data is not ready yet as illustrated in <a href="#FIG9-1">Polling</a>. For example, if you&#8217;re running an online auctions and sends the request to see the updated bids, you won&#8217;t receive any data back unless someone placed a new bid. Visualize a child seating on back seat of your car and asking every minute, "Have we arrived yet?" . And you&#8217;re politely replying, "Not just yet" - this is similar to an empty server response. There is no valuable payload for this kid, but she&#8217;s still receiving some "metadata". HTTP polling may result in receiving verbose HTTP response headers bearing no data load, let alone destructing the driver (think the server) from performing other responsibilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG9-1" class="paragraph">
  <div class="title">Polling</div>  
  <p><span class="image">
  <img src="./images/images/fig_09_01.png" alt="image">
</span></p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_long_polling">Long Polling</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><em>Long polling</em> (see <a href="#FIG9-2">Long Polling</a> ) starts similarly to polling: the client sends the HTTP request to the server. But in this case instead of sending an empty response back, the server waits till the data for the client becomes available. If the requested information is not available within the specified time interval, the server sends an empty response to the client, closes, and re-establishes the connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We&#8217;ll give you one more analogy to compare polling and long polling. Imagine a party at the top floor of a building equipped with a smart elevator that goes up every minute and opens the door just in case if one of the guests wants to go down to smoke a cigarette. If no one enters the elevator, it goes to the ground level and in 60 seconds goes up again. This is the polling scenario. But if this elevator would go up, and waited till someone would actually decide to go down, then we could call it a long polling mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>From the HTTP specification perspective this hack is legit: the long polling mode may seem as if we deal with the slow-responding server. That is why this technique also referred as <em>Hanging GET</em>. If you see an online auction that automatically modifies the prices as people bid on items it looks as if the server pushes the data to you. But the chances are, this functionality was implemented using long polling, which is not a real server-side data push, but its emulation.</p>

</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_http_streaming">HTTP Streaming</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The client sends the request for data. As soon as the server gets the data ready, it starts streaming (adding more and more data to the response object) without closing the connections. The server pushes the data to the client pretending that the response never ends <a href="#FIG9-3">HTTP Streaming</a>. For example, requesting a video from Youtube.com results in streaming data (frame after frame) without closing the HTTP connection.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Polling and streaming can be used as a fall-back for legacy browsers that don&#8217;t support the HTML5 APIs <em>Server-Sent Events</em> and <em>WebSocket</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_server_sent_events">Server-Sent Events</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Before diving into the WebSocket protocol lets get familiar with the standardized way of implementing  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/">Server-Sent Events</a>. W3C has published an API for Web browsers to allow them to subscribe to the events sent by the server. All modern browsers support the <tt>EventSource</tt> object, which can handle events arriving in the form of DOM events. This is not a reqiest-response paradigm, but rather a unidirectional data push - from server to browser. The following code snippet shows how a Web browser can subscribe and listen to server-sent events.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var source;
if( !! window.EventSource) {
    source = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/donate_web/api/donations/events');  // <b>&lt;1&gt;</b>
} else {
    // notify use that her browser doesn't support SSE
}

source.addEventListener('open', function(e) {                   // <b>&lt;2&gt;</b>
    // Connection was opened.
}, false);

source.addEventListener('create', function(e) {                 // <b>&lt;3&gt;</b>
    // do something with data
}, false);

source.addEventListener('update', function(e) {                 // <b>&lt;4&gt;</b>
    // do something with data
}, false);

source.addEventListener('error', function(e) {
    if(e.readyState == EventSource.CLOSED) {
        // Connection was closed.
    }
}, false);</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
  
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>
      <p>Create a new <tt>EventSource</tt> object. At this point the browser will send the <tt>GET</tt> request to the specified server-side endpoint to register itself on the server.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Add handlers for the <tt>open</tt> and <tt>error</tt> events.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Handle messages in <tt>create</tt> events by processing of the <tt>e.data</tt> content.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Handle messages in <tt>update</tt> events by processing of the <tt>e.data</tt> content.</p>
    </li>
  
  </ol>
  
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The above samples create listeners to subscribe specifically <tt>create</tt> and <tt>update</tt> events, but if you&#8217;d like to subscribe to any events, you could have used the following syntax:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">source.onmessage(function(e){
    // process the content of e.data here
});</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>SSE is a good technique for the use cases when the client doesn&#8217;t need to send the data to the server. In the above example the server sends two types of custom events <tt>create</tt> and <tt>update</tt> to notify subscribed clients about updated donation data so the active clients can monitor the fund-raising process. You can create as many custom events as needed by the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The server sends events as text messages that start with <tt>data:</tt> and end with a pair of new line characters, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">'data: {"price": "123.45"}/n/n`</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>SSE is still HTTP-based, and it requires server&#8217;s support of the combination of HTTP 1.1 keep-alive connections and the <tt>text/event-stream</tt> content type in HTTP response. The overhead is minimal - instead of hundreds of bytes in request and response headers, the server sends only the responses when the data has changed.</p>

In fact, these two factors alone are enough to make WebSocket seriously interesting to Google.</p>

  <p>WebSocket is a bi-directional full-duplex socket-based protocol. According to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a>  - the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard document - the goal of WebSocket technology is to provide a mechanism for Web applications that need two-way communications with servers. This technology doesn&#8217;t rely on HTTP hacks or on opening multiple connections using <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> or <tt>&lt;iframe&gt;</tt> and long polling. The idea behind WebSocket is not overly complicated:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Establish a socket connection between the client and the server using HTTP for the initial handshake.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Switch the communication protocol from HTTP to a socket-based protocol.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Send messages in both directions simultaneously (a.k.a. full duplex mode).</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Send messages independently. This is not a request-response model as both the server and the client can initiate the data transmission which enables the real server-side push.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Both the server and the client can initiate disconnects too.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>

  <p>The WebSocket protocol defines two new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme">URI schemes</a> <tt>ws</tt> and <tt>wss</tt> for unencrypted and encrypted connections respectively. The <tt>ws</tt> (WebSocket) URI scheme is similar to HTTP URI scheme and identifies that a WebSocket connection will be established using TCP/IP protocol without encryption. The`wss` (WebSocket Secure) URI scheme identifies that the traffic over that connection will be protected via Transport Layer Security (TLS). The TLS connection provides such benefits over TCP connection as data confidentiality, integrity, and the endpoint authentication. Apart from the scheme name, WebSocket URI schemes use generic URI syntax.</p>

      <p>The constructor requires an endpoint URI and optional sub-protocols names. A sub-protocol is an application-level protocol layered over the WebSocket Protocol. The client-side application can explicitly indicate which sub-protocols are acceptable for the conversation between the client and server. That string will be send to the server with the initial handshake as <tt>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol</tt> <tt>GET</tt> request header field. If the server supports one of the requested protocols it selects at most one of acceptable protocols and echoes that value in the same header parameter <tt>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol</tt> in the handshake&#8217;s response. Thereby the server indicates that it has selected that protocol. It could be a custom protocol or one of standard application level protocols (see <a href="#Auction_Messages_Specification">[Auction_Messages_Specification]</a>). For example, it&#8217;s possible to transfer the SOAP or XMPP messages over the WebSocket connection. We&#8217;ll discuss the handshake in the <a href="#HANDSHAKE">[HANDSHAKE]</a> section.</p>

  <h5 id="HANDSHAKE">WebSocket Handshake</h5>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Any network communications that use WebSocket protocol start with an opening handshake. The handshake upgrades the connection from HTTP to the WebSocket protocol. It&#8217;s an upgrade to a message-based communications. We will discuss messages (a.k.a. frames) later in this chapter. Why upgrade from HTTP instead of starting with the TCP as a protocol in the first place? The reason is that the WebSocket operates on the same ports (80 and 443) as HTTP and HTTPS do. It&#8217;s an important advantage that the browser&#8217;s requests are routed through the same ports because arbitrary socket connections may not be allowed by the enterprise firewalls for security reasons. Also, many corporate networks only allow certain outgoing ports. And HTTP/HTTPS ports are usually included in so called <em>white lists</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The protocol upgrade is initiated by the client request, which also transmits a special key with the upgrade request. The server processes this request and sends back a confirmation for the upgrade. This ensures that a WebSocket connection can be established only with an endpoint that support WebSocket. Here is what the handshake can look like in the client&#8217;s request:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre>
    GET HTTP/1.1
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    Host: echo.websocket.org
    Origin: http://www.websocket.org
    Sec-WebSocket-Key: i9ri`AfOgSsKwUlmLjIkGA==
    Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
    Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
</pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This client sends the <tt>GET</tt> request for the protocol upgrade. The <tt>Sec-WebSocket-Key</tt> is just a set of random bytes. The server takes these bytes and appends to this key a special Global Unique Identifier (GUID) string <tt>258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11</tt>, then it creates the Secure Hash Algorithm <tt>SHA1</tt> hash from it performs the <em>base64</em> encoding. The resulting string of bytes needs to be used by both the server and the client, and this string won&#8217;t be used by the network endpoints that do not understand the WebSocket protocol. Then this value would be copied in the <tt>Sec-WebSocket-Accept</tt> header field. The server computes the value and sends the response back confirming the protocol upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre>
    HTTP/1.1 101 Web Socket Protocol Handshake

    Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.websocket.org
</pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The WebSocket protocol uses the <tt>400 Bad Request</tt> HTTP error code to signal the unsuccessful upgrade. The handshake can also include a sub-protocol request and the WebSocket version information but you can&#8217;t include arbitrary other headers. We can&#8217;t transmit the authorization information. There are two ways around this. You can either transmit the authorization information as the first request (e.g. unique <tt>clientId</tt> can be passed as part of the HTTP request header or HTML wrapper) or put it into the URL as a query parameter during the initial handshake. Consider the following example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">var clientId = "Mary1989";                                   // <b>&lt;1&gt;</b>
ws = new WebSocket("ws://www.websocket.org/echo/"+clientID); // <b>&lt;2&gt;</b>
</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
  
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>
      <p>The client the <tt>clientId</tt> value (can be obtained from some LDAP server).</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The client connects to the WebSocket endpoint with an extra URI parameter which will be stored on server for future interactions.</p>
    </li>
  
  </ol>
  
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Because WebSocket protocol creates a bi-directional (socket-to-socket) connection, the server has access to the conversation session associated with such a connection. This session can be associated with clientId and be stored on server.</p>

  <h5 id="FRAMES">The WebSocket Frame Anatomy</h5>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The WebSocket handshake is the first step to switching to the message framing protocol, which will be layered over TCP. In this section we&#8217;re going to explore how the WebSocket data transfer works. The WebSocket is not a stream based protocol like TCP - it&#8217;s message based. The difference is that with TCP a program sends stream of bytes, which has to have a specific indication that the data transfer ends.
The WebSocket specification makes it easier because it puts a frame around every chunk of data, and the size of the frame is known. JavaScript can easily handle these frames on the client because each frame arrives packaged in the event object. But the server side has to work a little harder as it needs to wrap each piece of data into a frame before sending it to the client. A frame can look like this:</p>

  <h5 id="_the_heartbeats">The Heartbeats</h5>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Properly design distributed application has to have a way to ensure that each tier of the system is operational even if there is no active data exchange between the client and the server. This can be done by implementing so called <em>heartbeats</em> - a small messages that simply ask the other party, "Are you there?". For example, proxy servers and content-filtering hardware can terminate idle connections or the server could simply go down. If a client doesn&#8217;t send any requests, say for 20 seconds, but the server went down, the client will know about it only when it does the next <tt>send()</tt>. Heartbeats will keep the connection alive to ensure that it won&#8217;t look idling. In the WebSocket jargon heartbeats are implemented with <em>ping and pong</em> . The browser sends the <em>ping</em> opcode <tt>0x9</tt> at any time to ask the other side to <em>pong</em> back (the opcode <tt>0xA</tt>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Web browser can ping the server when required, but a pong may be sent at server&#8217;s discretion. If the  endpoint receives a ping frame before responding the the previous one, the endpoint can elect to send just one pong frame for the most recently processed ping. The ping frame may contain the application data (can be up to 125 bytes) and pong must have identical data in its message body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There is no JavaScript API to send pings or receive pong <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/network.html#ping-and-pong-frames">frames</a>. Pings and pongs may or may not be supported by the user&#8217;s browser. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13104">There is also no API</a> to enable, configure or detect whether the browser supports pings and pongs.</p>

  <h5 id="_data_frames">Data Frames</h5>
  
<div class="paragraph">

  <h3 id="_websocket_frameworks">WebSocket Frameworks</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Working with the vanilla WebSocket API requires you to do some additional "housekeeping" coding on you own. For example, if the client&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support WebSocket natively, you need to make sure that your code falls back to the legacy HTTP protocol. The good news is that there are frameworks that can help you with this task. Such frameworks lower the development time, allowing you to do more with less code. We&#8217;ve included brief reviews of two frameworks that can streamline your Web application development with WebSocket.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The frameworks mentioned below try to utilize the best supported transport by the current Web browser and server while sparing the developer from knowing internals of the used mechanism. The developer can concentrate on programming the application logic making calls to frameworks API when the data transfer is needed. The rest will be done by framework.</p>

  <h4 id="_the_portal">The Portal</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/flowersinthesand/portal">Portal</a> is a server agnostic JavaScript library. It aims to utilize a WebSocket protocol and provides a unified API for various transports (long polling, HTTP streaming, WebSocket). Currently, once you&#8217;ve decided to use WebSocket API for your next project, you need to remember about those users who still use old browsers like Internet Explorer 9 or older, which don&#8217;t natively support WebSockets. In this case, your application should gracefully fall back to the best available networking alternative. Manually writing code to support all possible browsers and versions requires lots of time especially for testing and maintaining the code for different platforms. The <tt>Portal</tt> library could help as illustrated in the following brief code sample.</p>

<div class="colist arabic">
  
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>
      <p>The Portal framework supports different transports and can fall back from WebSocket connection to streaming or long polling. The server also has to support some fall-back strategy, but no additional code required on the client side.</p>

  <p>The Portal framework generalizes the client-side programming. With defining an array of transports, you don&#8217;t have to worry about how to handle message sent by server with different transport.

  <h4 id="_atmosphere">Atmosphere</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A Web application that has to be deployed on several different servers (e.g. WebSphere, JBoss, WebLogic)
may need to support different WebSocket APIs. At the time of this writing, there is a plethora of different implementations of the server-side libraries supporting WebSockets, and each of them uses their own proprietary APIs. The upcoming Java EE 7 specification intends to change the situation. But Atmosphere is a framework that allows you to write portable Web applications today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere">Atmosphere</a> is a <strong>portable</strong> WebSocket framework supporting Java, Groovy, and Scala. The Atmosphere Framework contains both client and server components for building Asynchronous Web Applications. The Atmosphere transparently supports WebSocket, Server Side Events, long-polling, HTTP streaming, and JSONP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The client side component <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/jQuery.atmosphere.js-API">Atmosphere.js</a> uses The Portal framework internally and simplifies the development of Web applications that require a fall back from the WebSocket protocol to long polling or HTTP streaming. The Atmosphere Framework hides the complexity of the asynchronous APIs, which differ from server to server and makes your application portable among them. Treat Atmosphere as a compatibility layer that allows to select best available on server transport for all major Java application servers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Atmosphere framework supports wide range of Java based server-side technologies via a set of <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Atmosphere-PlugIns-and-Extensions">extensions and plugins</a>.

  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>Live trading/auctions/sports notifications</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For the next version of Save Sick Child application we&#8217;re going to use WebSocket to implement an online auction communication layer. The goal is to let individuals and businesses purchase hand-made crafts and arts made by children. All proceeds will go to help sick children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Having said that WebSocket protocol is a great solution, it has the downside too: the WebSocket specification defines only the protocol for transporting frames, but it doesn&#8217;t include the application-level protocol. Developers need to invent the application-specific text or binary protocols. For example, the auction bid has to be presented in a form agreed upon by all application modules. Let&#8217;s discuss our options from protocol modeling perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Selecting a message format for your application&#8217;s data communications is important. The most common text formats are CSV, XML, and JSON. They are easy to generate, parse, and are widely supported by many frameworks in the most development platforms. While XML and JSON allow you to represent the data in a hierarchical and easily readable by humans form, they create a lot of overhead by wrapping up each data element into additional text identifiers. Sending such additional textual information requires extra bandwidth and may need additional string-to-type conversion on both the client and server&#8217;s application code. The binary format is an alternative way of sending data. Let&#8217;s discuss the pros and cons of these message formats.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_csv">CSV</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>CSV stands for Comma Separated Values although the delimiter can be any character, not only the comma. This depends on the parser design and implementation. Another popular type of delimiter is <tt>|</tt> - "pipe" .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Pros:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>This format is very compact. The overhead of the separator symbol is minimal.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>It&#8217;s simple to create and parse. The CSV message can be turned into array of values by using the standard JavaScript <tt>String.split()</tt>.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Cons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>It&#8217;s not suitable for storing complex data structures and hierarchies. In case of an auction application, we need transfer to client auction items' attributes for each auction. In this case we can&#8217;t simply use <tt>String.split()</tt> and have to design and implement more complex parser.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_xml">XML</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language, and it nicely represents any hierarchal data structures.</p>

<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>It&#8217;s a human-readable format.</p>

    <li>
      <p>Most browsers have build-in XML readers and parsers.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>XML data can be validated against XSD or DTD schema.</p>
      
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>XML schema is very useful language feature as it defines the structure, content and semantic of XML document.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>The XML validation on the client is a complex task. As for now, there is no platform independent solutions or the API to perform validation programmatically based on XSD or DTD.</p>

  <p>Google Protocol Buffers is a language and platform-neutral extensible mechanism for structured data serialization.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A developer needs to specify how the serializable information has to be structured by defining the protocol buffer message types in the <tt>.proto</tt> files. Each protocol buffer message is a small logical record of information, containing a series of the name/value pairs. This protocol buffer message file is language agnostic. The <tt>protoc</tt> utility compiles <tt>proto</tt> files and produces language specific artifacts, e.g. <tt>.java</tt>, <tt>.js</tt>, etc files.</p>

  <h3 id="_websockets_and_proxies">WebSockets and Proxies</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The WebSocket protocol itself is unaware of intermediaries such as proxy servers, firewalls, content filters. The proxy servers are commonly used for content caching, security and enterprise content filtering.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>HTTP always supported protocol upgrades, but many proxy servers seem to have ignored that part of the specification. Until the WebSocket came around the <tt>Upgrade</tt> attribute was not used. The problem with Web applications that use long-lived connection like WebSocket is that the proxy servers may choose to close streaming or idle WebSocket connections, because they appear to be trying to connect to the unresponsive HTTP server. Additionally, proxy servers may buffer unencrypted HTTP responses assuming that the browser needs to receive the HTTP response in its entirety.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you want to get more details on how a WebSocket-enabled application has to deal with proxies there is comprehensive research paper by Google&#8217;s Peter Lubbers <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/Web-Sockets-Proxy-Servers/">WebSocket and proxy servers</a>.</p>

        The author of this book use <a href="http://nginx.com/">NGINX</a>, a hugely popular load balancer and proxy server to serve static resources (e.g. images and text files), balance the load between Java servers, and for SSL offloading (turning Web browser&#8217;s HTTPS requests into HTTP). NGINX uses a very small number threads to support thousands concurrent users as opposed to traditional Web servers that use one worker thread per connection. Recently NGINX started supporting WebSockets protocol.

  <h3 id="_adding_an_auction_to_save_sick_child">Adding an Auction to Save Sick Child</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>We gave you just enough of a theory to whet your appetite to start implementing WebSocket in our Save Sick Child application. The goal is to create an auction where people can bid and purchase various goods so the proceeds would go to sick children. Auctions require real-time communications - everyone interested in the particular auction item must be immediately notified if she was overbid or won. So we&#8217;ll use WebSocket as a means for bidding and notifications of the changes in the auction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>To start the auction, the user has to select the <em>Auction</em> option under the menu <em>Way To Give</em> (see <a href="#FIG9-9">Initially only two modules are loaded</a>). We realize that only a small number of users will decide to participate in the auction, which from the architectural point of view means that the code supporting the auction should be loaded <em>on demand</em> only if the user chooses to visit the auction. This why we need to write this code as a loadable module, and the reader will get a practical example of how a Web application can be modularized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this chapter we continue to use RequireJS (see Chapter 7) as a framework for modularization. Using RequireJS, we&#8217;re going to lazy load some modules if and only if they get requested by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This book is about development of the user interface and client side of the Web applications hence we&#8217;re not going to cover all the details of server side implementation, but will make our server side code available for download. We&#8217;ll keep our server up and running so you can test the UI by visiting <a href="http://savesickchild.org:8080/project-16-websocket-auction/,">http://savesickchild.org:8080/project-16-websocket-auction/,</a> but our main goal in this section is to show you how you can exchange the auction data with the server and process them on the client side using WebSocket. We&#8217;ll use the Java application server GlassFish 4, which is a reference implementation of the latest Java EE 7 specification.</p>

As we learned earlier in this chapter, the total size of the frame is slightly different from the size of the payload. There are few more bytes for the frame header. Moreover, all outgoing messages will be masked by the browser (see the note in the <a href="#FRAMES">[FRAMES]</a> section). This frame&#8217;s mask is going to be transferred to the server as a part of the frame itself, which creates additional 32 bits (4 bytes) overhead.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>After reading this chapter you should see the benefits of using WebSocket protocol in Web applications. In many cases WebSocket is an ultimate means for improving the application performance by reducing the network latency and removing the HTTP-headers overhead. You&#8217;ve learned how to integrate the WebSocket-based functionality into the existing HTTP-based application Save Sick Child. There is no need to make the entire communication of the Web application over WebSocket. Use this powerful protocol when it&#8217;s clearly improves the performance and responsiveness of your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>As a side benefit, you&#8217;ve learned how to use the network monitoring capabilities of Google Chrome Developer Tools and Wireshark application by sniffing the WebSocket traffic. You can&#8217;t underestimate the importance of monitoring tools, which are the best friends of Web developers.</p>

<div class="sect1">
  <h2 id="_responsive_design_one_site_fits_all">Responsive Design: One Site Fits All</h2>
  
  <div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Up till now we&#8217;ve been writing and re-writing the desktop version of the Save Sick Child application. Will it look good on the small screen of a mobile device? Starting from this chapter we&#8217;ll deal with the mobile devices too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s discuss different approaches to developing a Web application that can work on both desktop and mobile devices. There are three choices:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p>In addition to your Web application that works on desktops develop separate version of native applications for each mobile device. Developing of native mobile applications is not covered in this book.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Develop one HTML5 Web application, but create several different UI layouts that will be applied automatically based on the screen size of the user&#8217;s device.</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>In addition to your Web application that works on desktops develop a <em>hybrid application</em>, which is a Web application on steroids - it works inside the mobile browser, but can invoke native API of the mobile device too. Chapter 14 is dedicated to hybrid applications.</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This chapter is about the second approach called <em>Responsive Design</em>. This term was coined by Ethan Marcotte in the article <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a>. The design of the Web page changes responding (reacting) to the user&#8217;s display size. We&#8217;ll modify the design of the Save Sick Child site to introduce different layouts for the desktop, tablet, and smart phones. By the end of this chapter the site Save Sick Child will automatically change its layout based on the user&#8217;s device without the losing functionality.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_one_or_two_versions_of_code">One or Two Versions of Code?</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Run any of the versions of our Save Sick Child applications on your desktop and start dragging the right border of the browser&#8217;s window to make it narrower. At some point you&#8217;ll see only a part of the content - the layout of Save Sick Child was not meant to be responsive. It defined fixed sizes for the page sections, which didn&#8217;t change even if the display area shrinks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Enter the address of one of the <a href="http://savesickchild.org:8080/project-15-dynamic-content-modules/">Save Sick Child</a> projects in your mobile phone&#8217;s browser. Either you&#8217;ll see a partial content of the page or the entire page with illegible small fonts. Our design of the Save Sick Child application doesn&#8217;t look good on all devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>How many versions of the UI do we need to create then? People responsible for developing a Web applications that can run on both desktop and mobile platforms usually start with making an important decision: HTML5 or native?  But even if a decision was made in the favor of the Web platform, the next question is if the desktop and mobile clients will use the same code or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If a decision is made to go with separate versions of the Web applications, the Web server can be configured to perform the redirection to the appropriate code depending on the type of the user&#8217;s device. Web servers can do it based on the value of the <tt>User-Agent</tt> attribute of the HTTP request header. For example, the mobile Web browsers trying to access of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a> (or any other Web page) report their <tt>User-Agent</tt> to the server differently from desktop computers  hence they receive different content delivered from a different URL. The snapshots <a href="#FIG11-1">The desktop version of bbc.com</a> and <a href="#FIG11-2">The mobile version of bbc.com</a> of the BBC main page were taken at the same time, but <a href="#FIG11-1">The desktop version of bbc.com</a> shows how the page looks on the desktop computer, while <a href="#FIG11-2">The mobile version of bbc.com</a> was taken from the iPhone.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG11-1" class="imageblock">
  <div class="content">
    
    <img src="./images/fig_11_01.jpg" alt="fig_11_01">
    
  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 133. The desktop version of bbc.com</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <a href="#FIG11-1">The desktop version of bbc.com</a> page layout delivers more content as it can be allocated nicely on the large desktop monitor or a tablet. But the mobile version on <a href="#FIG11-2">The mobile version of bbc.com</a> substantially limits what&#8217;s delivered to the client, which is done not only because the screen is small, but the user may be accessing the page over the slower network.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG11-2" class="imageblock">
  <div class="content">
    
    <img src="./images/fig_11_02.png" alt="fig_11_02">
    
  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 134. The mobile version of bbc.com</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Have you ever tried to share the link of the Web site from your iPhone? It&#8217;s so easy! Just press the button and enter the email of the person to share the site with. Go to bbc.com from your iPhone or Android phone and share this link with someone. That person will receive the link <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/i/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/i</a>, and if she&#8217;s visit this site from the desktop it won&#8217;t look pretty. It&#8217;ll just show the wider version of what you see in <a href="#FIG11-2">The mobile version of bbc.com</a>. Try to enter this URL in your desktop browser to see for yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Maintaining two different versions of the application code requires more efforts than maintaining one: you need to have two sets of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Besides, most likely your Web application will use a  third-party JavaScript framework. At some point you may run into a bug and will need to upgrade the mobile version to use the latest version of, say jQuery framework. But the desktop version works just fine. In case of having two separate versions of the application you&#8217;ll have to either upgrade jQuery and thoroughly test both mobile and desktop versions of Save Sick Child, or live with two different versions of the framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Responsive design allows you to create one version of the Web application, which includes multiple sections of CSS controlling page layouts for different screen sizes. In this chapter we&#8217;ll create yet another version of the  Save Sick Child application that will render UI differently on desktop and mobile devices. All these version will share the same HTML and JavaScript code, but will include several versions of styling using <em>CSS media queries</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There is a number of Web sites that were built using responsive design. Visit the following Web sites first from the desktop computer and then from smart phones (or just lower the width of the desktop browser window) to experience such fluid responsive design:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://bostonglobe.com/">Boston Globe</a></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://cafeevoke.com/">Cafe Evoke</a></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://www.fork-cms.com/">Fork CMS</a></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://forefathersgroup.com/">Forefathers</a></p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Note that each of these Web pages displays the content on the desktop in three different layouts (often in three imaginary columns). As you make the window narrower, the layout will automatically switch to the tablet or a large smartphone mode (usually two columns layout), and then to the phone mode layout (the one column layout).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This sounds like a great solution, but keep in mind that your users will be downloading unnecessary bytes - the entire CSS file that includes all versions of screen layouts. This is not the case in the BBC example, which has different versions of the code that load only what&#8217;s necessary for a particular device category.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now comes the million dollar question, "Do we need to create two different versions of the Web application or twenty two?  Why not two hundred and twenty two?" How many different mobile devices are there today and will be there tomorrow?</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_how_many_user_agents_are_there">How Many User Agents Are There</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The HTTP header&#8217;s attribute <tt>User-Agent</tt> contains information about the user agent originating request. Should you decide to create several versions of the UI based on the value in the <tt>User-Agent</tt> field, you can refer to the Web site <a href="http://useragentstring.com">http://useragentstring.com</a>. It lists not two, but hundreds of strings representing possible content of the <tt>User-Agent</tt> attribute for a variety of desktop and mobile devices. For example, <a href="#FIG11-3">The User-Agent String from iPhone 5</a> shows how the <tt>User-Agent</tt> string from  iPhone5 is reported and explained by <a href="http://useragentstring.com/">useragentstring.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG11-3" class="imageblock">
  <div class="content">
    
    <img src="./images/fig_11_03.png" alt="fig_11_03">
    
  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 135. The User-Agent String from iPhone 5</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There is an easier  way to detect on the server that the request came from a mobile device. <a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/">Wireless Universal Resource File (WURF)</a> is a database of thousands of supported devices and their properties. Such Internet giants as Facebook and Google rely on this service and your application could too, if need be. WURF offers APIs from several programming languages to detect specific capabilities of the user devices. For example, the following code snippet is how you could access the WURF data from a Java servlet.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html"> protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
          throws ServletException, IOException {

   WURFLHolder wurfl = (WURFLHolder) getServletContext().getAttribute(WURFLHolder.class.getName());

   WURFLManager manager = wurfl.getWURFLManager();

   Device device = manager.getDeviceForRequest(request);

   log.debug("Device: " + device.getId());
   log.debug("Capability: " + device.getCapability("preferred_markup"));</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>It&#8217;s impossible to create different layouts of a Web application for thousands of user agents. Grouping devices by screen sizes is a more practical approach for lowering the number of UI layouts supported by your application. The responsive design is a collection of techniques based upon three pillars:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
  
  <ol class="arabic">
  
    <li>
      <p>CSS <em>media queries</em></p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><em>Fluid grids</em> or fluid layouts</p>
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>Fluid media</p>
      
    </li>
  
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Media queries allows to rearrange the sections (<tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt><em>s</em>) of the page based on the screen size, fluid grids allows to properly scale the content of these sections, and the fluid media is about resizing images or videos. But before going into technical details, let&#8217;s get back to the mockups to see how the UI should look like on different devices.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


  
</div>


<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_back_to_mockups">Back to Mockups</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Jerry, our Web designer came up with another set of Balsamiq mockups for the Save Sick Child application. This time he had four different versions: desktop, tablet, large phone, and small phone. As a matter of fact, Jerry provided more mockups - the user can hold both smartphones and tablets either in portrait or landscape mode.  <a href="#FIG11-4">The Desktop layout</a>, <a href="#FIG11-5">The tablet layout (portrait)</a>, and <a href="#FIG11-6">The large phone layout (portrait)</a>, <a href="#FIG11-7">The small phone layout (portrait)</a> show the screenshots taken from Balsamiq Mockups for desktop, tablet, large, and small phone layouts. <a href="#FIG11-4">The Desktop layout</a> shows the desktop mockup.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG11-4" class="imageblock">
  <div class="content">
    
    <img src="./images/fig_11_04.png" alt="fig_11_04">
    
  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 136. The Desktop layout</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Jerry gave us several version of the images - with and without the grid background. The use of the grid will be explained later in the section "Fluid Grids". <a href="#FIG11-5">The tablet layout (portrait)</a> depicts the rendering on tablet devices that fall in a category of under 768px width screen in the portrait mode.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG11-5" class="imageblock">

  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 137. The tablet layout (portrait)</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Next comes the mockup for the large smart phones having the width of up to 640 pixels. <a href="#FIG11-6">The large phone layout (portrait)</a> shows two different images of the screen next to each other (the user would need to scroll to see the second image).</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG11-6" class="imageblock">
  <div class="content">
    
    <img src="./images/fig_11_06.png" alt="fig_11_06">
    
  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 138. The large phone layout (portrait)</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The mockup for the smaller phones with the width of under 480 pixels is shown on <a href="#FIG11-7">The small phone layout (portrait)</a>. The mockup looks wide, but it actually shows three views of the phone screen next to each other. The user would need to scroll vertically to see the middle or the right view. Physical screens are not too small - iPhone 3 falls into this category, but resolution-wise they are smaller.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG11-7" class="imageblock">
  <div class="content">
    
    <img src="./images/fig_11_07.png" alt="fig_11_07">
    
  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 139. The small phone layout (portrait)</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If need be, you can ask Jerry to create mockups for the real devices with the width under 320 pixels, but we won&#8217;t even try it here. Now we need to translate these mockups into working code. The first subject to learn is CSS media queries.</p>
</div>

  
</div>


<div class="sect2">
  <h3 id="_css_media_queries">CSS Media Queries</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>First, let&#8217;s see the CSS media queries in action, and then we&#8217;ll explain how this magic was done. Run Aptana&#8217;s project titled Responsive_basic_media_queries, and it&#8217;ll look as in <a href="#FIG11-8">The tesktop layout implemented</a>. This is a desktop version for the desktops (or some tablets in the landscape mode). The section chart, map, and video divide the window into three imaginary columns.</p>

  <p>Drag the right border of your desktop Web browser&#8217;s window to the left to make it narrower. After reaching certain <em>breakpoint width</em> (in our project it&#8217;s 768 pixels) you&#8217;ll see how the <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt><em>s</em> reallocate themselves into the two-column window shown on <a href="#FIG11-9">The tablet layout (portrait) implemented</a>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Keep making the browser&#8217;s window narrower, and when the width will pass another breakpoint (becomes less than 640 pixels), the window will re-arrange itself into one long column as in <a href="#FIG11-10">The smaller phone layout (portrait) implemented</a>. The users will have to use scrolling to see the lower portion of this window, but they don&#8217;t loose any content.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The W3C Recommendation titled <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">Media Queries</a> has been introduced in CSS2 and HTML4. The idea was to provide different stylesheets for different media. For example, you can specify different stylesheets in HTML using the <tt>media</tt> attribute for the screens that are less than 640 pixel in width.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css" media="screen"&gt;

                       media="only screen and (max-width: 640px)"&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You may have several of such <tt>&lt;link&gt;</tt> - tags for different screen widths. But all of them will be loaded regardless of the actual size of the user&#8217;s display area. The modern browser may defer loading of the CSS files that don&#8217;t match the current display size.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The other choice is to specify a section in a CSS file using one or more <tt>@media</tt> rules. For example, the following style will be applied to the HTML element with the <tt>id=main-top-section</tt> if the width of the display area (screen) is less than 640 pixels. Screen is not the only media type that you can use with media queries. For example, you can use <tt>print</tt> for printed documents or <tt>tv</tt> for tv devices. For the up to date list of media types see the W3C Media Queries Recommendation.</p>

  <p>The fragment of the CSS file styles.css from the project Responsive_basic_media_queries is shown next. It starts with defining styles for windows having 1280px width (we use 1140 pixels to leave some space for padding and browser&#8217;s chrome). This CSS mandates to change the page layouts if the screen size is or becomes below 768 or 640 pixels. Based on your Web designer&#8217;s recommendations you can specify as many breakout sizes as needed. Say, in the future, everyone will have at lease 1900px wide monitor - you can provide a layout that would use five imaginary columns. This can be a good idea for online newspapers or magazines, but Save Sick Child is not a publication so we keep its maximum width within 1140px. Or you may decide to make a version of Save Sick Child available for LCDs of only 320px in width - create a new media query section in your CSS and apply fluid grids to make the content readable.</p>

    <div class="title">The Viewport Concept</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Mobile browsers use a concept of <em>viewport</em>, which is a virtual window where they render the Web page content. This virtual window can be wider than the actual width of the display of the user&#8217;s mobile device. For example, by default iOS Safari and Opera Mobile render the page to the width of 980px, and then shrinks it down to the actual width (320px on old iPhones and 640px on iPhone 4 and 5). By using the meta tag <tt>viewport</tt> your Web page overrides this default and renders itself according to the actual device size.  All code samples in this chapter include the <tt>viewport</tt> meta tag in index.html. All mobile browsers support it even though it&#8217;s not a part of the HTML standard yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">---
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
---</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>This meta tag tells the browser that the width of the virtual viewport should be the same as the width of the display. It&#8217;ll will work fine if your responsive design includes a version of the page layout optimized for the width of the user&#8217;s device. But if you&#8217;d be rendering a page that&#8217;s narrower than the default width of the display (e.g. 500 pixels) setting the attribute <tt>content="width=500"</tt> would allow the mobile Web browser to scale the page to occupy the entire display real estate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Setting the initial scaling to 1.0 ensures that the page will be rendered as close to the physical device size as possible. If you don&#8217;t want to allow the user scale the Web page, add the attribute <tt>user-scalable=no</tt> to the meta tag <tt>viewport</tt>.</p>

  <h4 id="_how_many_breakpoints">How Many Breakpoints?</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>How many media queries is too many? It all depends on the Web page you&#8217;re designing. In the sample CSS shown in this section above we&#8217;ve used the breakpoint of 768px to represent the width of the tablet in the portrait mode, and this is fine for the iPad. But several tablets (e.g. 10.1" Samsung Galaxy) have 800px-wide viewport while Microsoft Surface Pro is 1080px wide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There is no general rule as to how many breakpoint is needed for a typical Web page. But if there is a vieport width when you change the layout of the page, create a breakpoint for this width. Just create a simple Lorem Ipsum prototype of your Web site and start changing its size. If you don&#8217;t like how the content looks, you may need to create a breakpoint and define a media query for it. It is recommended to start with designing for the smallest viewports (the "Mobile First" principle). As the viewport width increases you may decide to render more content hence define a new breakpoint.</p>

  <p>Don&#8217;t try to create a pixel perfect layout using responsive design. Use common sense and remember, the more different media queries you provide the heavier your CSS file will become. But in mobile world you should try to create Web applications as slim as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Warning: Be prepared to see inconsistencies among the desktop browsers in measuring the width of the viewport. Our tests showed that WebKit-based browsers add about 15px to the width, supposedly accounting for the width of the scrollbar. So if you have a media query that has to change the layout at 768px, it&#8217;ll change it at about 783px. Do more testing on different viewports and adjust your CSS as needed.</p>

  <h3 id="_fluid_grids">Fluid Grids</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Fluid grids is a very important technique in the responsive design. Grids were used by Web designers for ages - a web page was divided by a number of imaginary rows and columns. But the fluid grid, as the name implies, is flexible and can scale based on the screen sizes.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_moving_away_from_absolute_sizing">Moving Away From Absolute Sizing</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When a browser displays text it uses its default font size unless it was overruled by the <tt>font-size</tt> property. Typically, the default font size is 16 pixels. But instead of using the absolute font size, you can use the relative one by using so called <em>em</em> units. The default browser&#8217;s font size can be represented by 1em. Since the font size happens to be 16px then 1em is 16 px.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The absolute sizes are enemies of the responsive design Web sites, and specifying the sizes in em unit allows you to create Web pages with the pretty flexible and fluid content. The size can be calculated based on a formula offered by Ethan Markotte in his <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fluidgrids/">article on fluid grids</a>: <tt>target/context=result</tt>, which in case of fonts becomes <tt>size-in-pixels/16 = size-in-em</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>For example, instead of specifying the size as 24px, you can set it to 1.5em: 24/16. In your CSS file you can write something like <tt>padding-bottom: 1.5em</tt>. This may seem not a big deal, but it is, because if everything is done in relative sizing, your page will look good and proportional regardless of the screen size and regardless of how big or small 24px may look on a particular screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If we are talking about em units for representing font sizes, the font becomes <em>the context</em>, but what if you want to represent the width of an arbitrary HTML component in a browser&#8217;s window or any other container? Then the width of your component becomes the <tt>target</tt> and the total width of the container becomes the <tt>context</tt>. We can still use the above formula, but will multiply the result by 100%. This way the width on an HTML component will be represented not in em, but in percentages relative to the total width of the container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s say the total width of the browser&#8217;s window is 768px, and we want to create a 120px-wide panel on the left, instead of specifying this width in pixels we&#8217;ll use the formula and turn it into percentages.We want to calculate the target&#8217;s width in percents of the available context (100%):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>120 / 768 * 100% = 15.625%</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Such approach makes the page design <em>fluid</em>. If someone decides to open this page on a 480px-wide screen, the panel will still take 15.625% of the screen rather than demanding 120 pixels, which would look substantially wider on a smaller viewport.</p>

  <p>Web designers use different approaches in styling with fluid grids. When you design a new page with Dreamweaver&#8217;s Fluid Grid Layout it suggests you to allocate different number of columns for desktop, tablet and mobile, for example, its default offer is to allocate 12 columns for the desktops, 8 for the tablets, and 5 for phones, which is perfectly solid approach. But our Web designer Jerry prefers using 12 columns for all screen sizes playing with the width percentages for different layouts - you&#8217;ll see how he does it in the project Responsive Donation Section later in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Now imagine that you&#8217;ll overlay the entire window with an invisible grid containing twelve equally sized columns. In this case each column will occupy 8.333% of the total width. Now, if you&#8217;d need to allocate to some HTML component about 40% of the total width, you could do this by allocating five grid columns (8.333% * 5 = 41.665%). Accordingly, your CSS file can contain 12 classes that you can use in your page:</p>

  <p>Now let&#8217;s see the fluid grid in action. Run the Aptana&#8217;s project Responsive Fluid Grid and you&#8217;ll see the Web page that looks similar to <a href="#FIG11-12">Fluid Grid on the wide screen</a>. This example changes the grid layout if the viewport width falls under one of the following width breakpoints: 768px, 640px, and 480px. In this context the term <em>breakpoints</em> here has nothing to do with debugging - we just want the content of the Web page to be rearranged when the width of the viewport passes one of these values.</p>

  <p>If you&#8217;ll start lowering the width of the browser&#8217;s window, you&#8217;ll see how the grid cells start squeezing, but the layout remains the same until the page size will become lower than one of the predefined breakpoints. Then another media query kicks in and the layout changes. For example, <a href="#FIG11-13">Fluid Grid on the viewport under 640px</a> shows the fragment of the Web page when the width of the browser&#8217;s window goes below 640px. The 12-, 6-, and 4-cell grids show all the cells vertically one under another. Only the 480px grids still have enough room to display their cells horizontally. But if you keep squeezing the window, all the grids will display their content in one column as long as the viewport width stays under 480px.</p>

        In some cases you may need to use a mix of fluid and fixed layouts, for example, you may need to include an image of a fixed size on your fluid Web page. In such cases you can use a fixed width on some of the elements, and if needed, consider using CSS tables (not to be confused with HTML tables). CSS tables <a href="http://caniuse.com/css-table">are supported</a> by all current browsers.

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>First, run any of the previous versions of the Save Sick Child application to make sure it was not responsive. Just make the browser window narrower, and you won&#8217;t see some of the page content on the right.
We&#8217;ll make the page responsive gradually - the first version will make the header responsive, then the donation section, and, finally the entire page will become fluid. Run the Aptana&#8217;s project named Responsive Header and you&#8217;ll see a page similar to <a href="#FIG11-14">Responsive Header (width 580px+)</a>.</p>

  <p>Initially, this code uses the <tt>four-column</tt> style (<tt>width: 33.332%;</tt> of the container) for the logo and <tt>eight-column</tt> (<tt>66.664%</tt>) for the <tt>&lt;nav&gt;</tt> element. When the size of the viewport changes, the appropriate media query takes  effect. Note the <tt>breakpoint-640</tt> class selector in the <tt>&lt;header&gt;</tt> tag above. Jerry, our Web designer, decided that 640 pixels is not enough to display the logo and the four links from the <tt>&lt;nav&gt;</tt> section in one row. Besides, he wanted to fine tune the width of other elements too. This is how the media query for the 640px viewport looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">@media only screen and (max-width: 640px) {
	.breakpoint-640 .cell {
		float: none;
		width: 100%;
		padding-bottom: 0.5em
	}

	header {
		margin-top: 1em;
	}
	#login {
		top: 1em;
	}
	#logo.four-column {
		width: 40%;
	}
	nav {
		width: 100%;
		margin-top: 0.8em
	}
	nav ul li {
		width: 24.5%;
		margin-left: 0.5%
	}
	nav li a {
		text-align: center;
		font-size: 0.6em;
	}
	#login-link-text {
		display: none;
	}
	a#login-submit {
		padding: 0.2em 0.5em
	}
	#login input {
		width: 9em;
	}
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>As you see, if the <tt>cell</tt> has to be styled inside <tt>breakdown-640</tt>, the float gets turned off (<tt>float: none;</tt>) and each of the navigation items has to take 100% of the container&#8217;s width. The <tt>logo</tt>, <tt>login</tt>, and <tt>nav</tt> elements will change too. There is no exact science here - Jerry figured out all these values empirically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Start slowly changing the width of the viewport, and you&#8217;ll see how the layout changes.
The styles.css of this project has media queries for different viewport sizes. For example, when the page width is below 580 pixels, but more than 480 pixels it&#8217;ll look as in <a href="#FIG11-15">Responsive Header 2 (width between 480 and 580px )</a>.</p>

  <div class="title">Figure 147. Responsive Header 2 (width between 480 and 580px )</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>When the width shrinks to 480px, the header looks as in <a href="#FIG11-16">Responsive Header (width below 480px)</a>. Once again, we are not tying the design to the specific device, but rather to a viewport width. The iPhone 4 will render this page using the layout shown at &lt;&lt;&gt;FIG11-16&gt;, but iPhone 5 will use the layout from <a href="#FIG11-15">Responsive Header 2 (width between 480 and 580px )</a>. You can&#8217;t go by a device type.</p>

  <p>The next version of the Aptana project to try is called Responsive Donation. This version make the donation section fluid. The donation section contains the Lorem Ipsum text and the form, which is revealed when the user clicks the button Donate. First, let&#8217;s look at the HTML. The index.html contains the following fragment (some of the content that irrelevant for layout was removed for better readability):</p>

   	  	  &lt;div id="donor-info" class="five-column left"&gt;</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The donation section is located in the <tt>main-top-section</tt> of the page. Jerry wanted to keep the image of the boy visible for as long as possible on the narrower viewports. The top section of the Save Sick Child has two backgrounds: the flowers (bg-2.png) and the boy (child-1.png). This is how they are specified in the style.css:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">#main-top-section {
	background: url(../img/child-1.png) no-repeat right bottom,
	            url(../img/bg-2.png) no-repeat 20% bottom;
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If the viewport is wide enough, both backgrounds will be shown. What&#8217;s wide enough? Jerry figured it out after experimenting. The <tt>seven-column</tt> style prescribes to allocate more than a half (58.331%) of the viewport width for the <tt>donation-address</tt> section and <tt>six-column</tt> (49.998%) for the donation form.  For example <a href="#FIG11-17">Responsive Donate Section: 570px</a> shows how the donation section will look when the viewport width is 570px.</p>
</div>
<div id="FIG11-17" class="imageblock">

    <img src="./images/fig_11_17.png" alt="fig_11_17">
    
  </div>
  <div class="title">Figure 149. Responsive Donate Section: 570px</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But when the width become less then 480px, there is no room for two background images, and only the flowers will remain on the page background. The media query for 480px viewport is shown next - note that the background in the main top section has only one image now: bg2.png. Floating is off to show the navigation menu vertically as in <a href="#FIG11-18">Responsive Donate Section under 480px</a>.</p>

  <p>The id of this section is still <tt>main-bottom-section</tt>, and it&#8217;s shown at the bottom of the page on wide viewports. Now take another look at the image <a href="#FIG11-9">The tablet layout (portrait) implemented</a>. Jerry wants to display these three sections at the right hand side for tablets in the portrait mode, and it&#8217;s shown on <a href="#FIG11-19">The Portrait Mode on Tablets</a>.</p>

  <p>The relevant code from the style.css is shown below.The top and bottom sections get about a half of the width each, and the floating is turned off so the browser would allocate charts, maps, and video vertically.</p>

  <h4 id="_fluid_media">Fluid Media</h4>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you responsive Web page contains images or videos, you want to make them fluid too - they should react to the current size of the containers they are in. Our page has a chart image and a video - both of them are made flexible, but we use different techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you&#8217;ll keep narrowing the viewport, the project Responsive Final will show the page with the layout similar to <a href="#FIG11-10">The smaller phone layout (portrait) implemented</a>. While reading the code of this project, visit the main.js file. There is some work done in the JavaScript too, which listens to the resize event for the charts container.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">window.addEventListener("resize", windowResizeHandler);
function windowResizeHandler() {
	drawPieChart(document.getElementById('svg-container'),
	                 donorsDataCache, labelsDataCache);
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Whenever the size changes, it invokes the function <tt>drawPieChart()</tt> that recalculates the width of the SVG container (it uses the <tt>clientWidth</tt> property of the <tt>HTMLElement</tt> ) and re-draws the chart accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The video is flexible too, and it&#8217;s done a lot simpler. We do not specify the fixed size of the video, but use a CSS property <tt>width</tt> instructing the browser to allocate the 100% of the available container&#8217;s width.The height of the video must be  be automatically calculated to keep the proportional size.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">video {
	width: 100% !important;
	height: auto !important;
}</code></pre>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The <tt>!important</tt> part disables regular cascading rules and ensures that these values will be applied overriding more specific width or height declarations, if any. If you prefer not always use the entire width of the container for the video, you can use the <tt>max-width: 100%;</tt>, which will display the video that fits in the container at its original size. If a video is larger than the container, the browser will resize it to fit inside the container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>While the landing Web page of your application simply includes links to the required images, the rest of the images should be loaded from the server by making AJAX requests with passing parameter regarding the viewport size. This way the server&#8217;s software can either resize images dynamically and include them as base-64 encoded strings or use pre-created properly sized images depending on the viewport dimensions.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="icon">
        
        <div class="title">Tip</div>
        
      </td>
      <td class="content">
        
        While using base-64 encoding increases the total size of the image in bytes, it allows you to group together multiple images to minimize the number of network calls the browser needs to make to retrieve these images separately. The other way to combine multiple images into one is CSS sprites.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Regardless of what the width and height of the image is, use tools to reduce image sizes in bytes. Some of such tools are <a href="http://tinypng.org/">TinyPNG</a> or <a href="http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/">Smush.it</a>. If you use <em>lossy</em> tools, some of the image data will be lost during compression, but in many cases the difference between the original and compressed image is invisible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Besides making images responsive, keep in mind that some people have mobile devices with high resolution retina displays. The problem is that to make an image look good on such displays its size has to be large, which increases its loading time. There is no common recipe for doing the image size optimization properly - plan to spend an extra time just to preparing the images for your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>There is a living W3C document titled <a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org/">An HTML extension for adaptive images</a> that will provide developers with a means to declare multiple sources for an image. The proposed  HTML element <tt>&lt;picture&gt;</tt> will allow to specify different images for different media (see <a href="http://responsiveimages.org/demos/">demos</a>), for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
  
  <div class="content monospaced">
    
    <pre class="highlight"><code class="html">&lt;picture width="500" height="500"&gt;
   &lt;source media="(min-width: 45em)" src="large.jpg"&gt;
   &lt;source media="(min-width: 18em)" src="med.jpg"&gt;
   &lt;source src="small.jpg"&gt;
   &lt;img src="small.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre>

  <h3 id="_summary_10">Summary</h3>
  
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Authors of this book have different opinions about the merits of responsive design. One of us simply stated, "I haven&#8217;t seen complex single-code-base applications that work well on Android, iPhone, and desktop browsers". The other responded "We need to compromise". With browser plugins like Flash Player or Silverlight you can choose pixel-perfect design. Just set a pre-requisite: the user must have a 1024x768 viewport minus chrome and margins. But if you&#8217;ll need to make this application work on highly fragmented Android market, on all iPhones, Blackberies, desktops, and other devices, ask yourself a simple question, "Do we have money to hire two or three teams for developing and supporting several versions of the application for different devices or we&#8217;d rather compromise, and push the HTML5-based product out the door?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Each enterprise project has a limited budget, and if you&#8217;ll agree to compromise and move away from the pixel-perfect world accepting the fact that the Donate button will look a little bit different on different devices, go with the responsive design principles and have one code base. You&#8217;ll provide different CSS sections that will automatically apply different layouts based on the viewport size, and the HTML markup and JavaScript will be the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Responsive design is not a silver bullet though. With this approach has drawbacks because unnecessary CSS will be loaded to the user&#8217;s device. This consideration is especially important for mobile devices operating on 3G or slower networks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Responsive design can still can be a practical business solution when the form factor is relatively low, e.g. if your target group of user operate the iPhones and the latest Android devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Also, using the same code and design for different platforms works perfectly only for publishing information and not for all Web applications. If you need to publish the information using different layout managers, responsive design is a good fit. Mobile applications could be compiled either into the native code or into some byte code that performs close to the native one. But the UI could be different based on the available screen real estate and use touch interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>If you&#8217;ll take any framework that works on both desktop and mobile devices, you&#8217;ll get two sets of controls and the need to maintain two different source code bases. Not using mobile JavaScript frameworks limits the number of user-friendly UI controls. Besides, frameworks spare you from dealing with browsers incompatibilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In this chapter you&#8217;ve seen how the Save Sick Child application  was built with responsive design principles. We have several areas (<tt>&lt;div&gt;'s</tt>) and one of them include a donation form (we could have added the responsive <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt> with the online auction too). On the wide screen we  displayed three  of these <tt>&lt;div&gt;'s</tt>  horizontally and two underneath, on the narrow screen each of these sections could scaled down and displayed one under another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But using responsive design for styles application that must run on a tablets or mobile devices will require Jerry-the-designer to work in tandem with the User Experience specialist so that UI will have larger controls and fonts, minimize the need of manual data entry. And don&#8217;t forget that half of the mobile screen could be covered by a virtual keyboard, and if you ignore this, the user will have to work with your UI via a keyhole, and even our fluid  <tt>&lt;div&gt;'s</tt> may not fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>In the next two chapters we&#8217;ll be working on yet another version of Save Sick Child. First, it&#8217;s going to be done with the jQuery Mobile framework and then with Sencha Touch.</p>
