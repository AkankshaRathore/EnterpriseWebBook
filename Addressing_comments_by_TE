Addressing the comments 

Authors agreed with most of the suggestions of the editors. This file includes only the authors' responses to the editors comments if we decided not to make to the book drafts.

Introduction, page XIV. We already mentioned Typescript and CoffeeScript. Mentioning Google's Closure compiler wouldn't be needed here.

Ch1, page 12. There is only one table and a paragraph that mention HTML5/browser compatibility - it's not enough for having a section with a subtitle. 

Ch1, page 16. Most likely the tech. editor didn't see the option "Run as JavaScript Web project" because he didn't select the project in Aptana before creating New From Template file. It works fine on Mac for us. But I made clarification in the text anyway. 

Ch1, page 20. We'll use both FireBug and Chrome Dev tools.

CH1, page 21 - no need to add more explanation here. 


Ch1, page 22. No subsections needed for a one-page section on gentle into to function. Also, it's not easy to not create a mess by jumping around from introducing objects without introducing functions and vica versa. I don't think we need to talk much about objects in the section on functions.

Ch1, page 23, this would be ambiguous: "This is useful if you want to delay â€¦"  ?"


Ch1, page 25 and 34. If you don't like the footnotes, the copy editor will replace them with in-code comments.   

Ch1, page 30. The tech editor is wrong - Firebug shows the variable this and window without the need to set them as watch variables.


Ch1, page 33. The tech editor is wrong - delete removes the property. Here's the reference: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete

Ch1, page 35. Do not remove the line "Printing the object referred by `emp` will output [object Object]."

Ch1, page 35. Don't agree with this comment: "I think it'd be better to only use Chrome Developer Tools in this book."  Developers use both Firebug and Chrome Dev tools, cause they have to use different browsers for testing/debugging. 

Ch1, page 36. Yes, this is the right place for this.

Ch1, page 70. Events are fired even if there is no listeners.

Ch1, page 73. If a person doesn't know how HTML, JavaScript, and CSS relate to each other, he can't read this book.


Ch 2, page 77. There's no need to single out Chrome here. 

Ch2, page 93. Re-writing footnotes is fine with me if the copy editor can do it.

Ch2, page 109 location id is about the location of the closest branch of the charity. Action - is about the actions in "what we do" - I just picked these variable names.

Build 10-28-2013, Developing Web Applications in Ext JS Framework

Pg. 234. Which IDE to use is irrelevant for Hello World type of apps.

Pg. 246. Bulleted list won't work here as it's not just three options. 

Pg. 253. Starting explaining specifics of MVC in the beginning of the chapter would be too soon IMO. But I've added a reference to the section MVC in Ext JS to the beginning of the chapter.

Pg. 255. Getters and Setters are well knows terms among programmers.

Pg. 258.  I didn't understand why you wanted to remove the sentence and the phrase from the section on component's lifecycle. The original version is right.

Pg. 269. It wouldn't be easy to show how to test separate layers here without explaining the process of testing. Added a better reference to the releant sections in CH8.

Pg. 278. No need to research more ide/web inspector features here.

Pg. 287. This comment seems to be an accidental  duplicate of the comment from pg 285.

====================

Build 11-7-13


====
Intro, ch1, ch2 - BR's comments

Page xxi - the tech editor is not sure if it's accurate. This is not a reason to change anything in my text.

Page 5. Disagree with BR, who works for Adobe and seeing things differently than independent developers. 
Page 7. We use not only Aptana, but other IDEs too. Also, there is a version of WebStorm that costs $59.


ch3

Pg 122. Not sure what the "Goofy indentation" comment means.

Pg. 155. Not sure what this comment means "add footnote here (the note below)".

I'm not sure what trick TR is referring to in here: 
TR: maybe metion the '//' trick here?  src="//google.com/jsapi"


ch5

Page 198. Using the protocol relative URLs (that omit http and start with //) has downsides. No need to mention it here.

Page 202. The function each() can be called without params.

Page 205. There is no need to talk about cross-domain here.

Page 213. This is not about handling errors with jQuery in general. This is just an illustration of how it can be done in one particular case of the Save The Child app. There was another mentioning of specific error handling situation in the section on Ajax with jQuery. I don't see a need to create a special section on error handling in general.

Page 213. We already mentioned the approximate size differences - there is no need to measure it on every project.

Page 222. Based on the recent Mary's suggestions, Aptana-related content may be removed.

Page 229. The paragraph about Bootstrap belongs here. Libraries and frameworks are being used together. It's not either or. 


========
Chapter on app security

Pg 443. Need to implement it. "This chapter is pretty clean and tight, although it feels like it's from another book (Because it doesn't have code examples, and we don't address the charity app). What about adding a login to charity app here? Or showing how to handle the paypal authentication?  

 Pg 454. The TR's comment "most dbs have a sharding/clustering solution" doesn't apply to the subj of this paragraph.

 Chapter on Responsive Design
 =======

Page 492. This comment is an observation that doesn't require changes in the draft;  "usually with mobile first you use min width since you start small and work up."

Page 505. The comment below is about responsive design, while the sentence is about different case when there are two version of the same framework, e.g. jQuery and jQuery Mobile.

 "aren't there any frameworks that handle responsive design? (so you wouldn't have to maintain two different source code repos)""

jQuery Mobile, Sencha Touch, Hybrid Chapters
====
Pg 415. No need to address Aptana comment since Aptana IDE is removed from the book.

Pg. 477. We do Hello World when it helps to get started with the environment. When it's not needed we don't.

Pg. 488 The URL of the repository of all source code samples is included in Preface

Pg. 543 The reference to the snapshot of the HelloWorld is added right below generated Hello World HTML. It's on Fig titled Running Hello World in XCode.

Pg. 543 I don't believe we need to add subheaders for distribution on iOS and Android, because this entire section contains mainly general notes on distribution here and there. 

Pg. 491 There is no onUpdated() event in Ext JS.
