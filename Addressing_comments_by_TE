Addressing the comments by Tech. Editor.

Authors agreed with most of the suggestions of the tech. editor. This file includes only the authors' responses to the tech. editor's comments if no changes were made to the text. 

Introduction, page XIV. We already mentioned Typescript and CoffeeScript. Mentioning Google's Closure compiler wouldn't be needed here.

Ch1, page 4. There is nothing wrong with "In the 90th, JavaScript was considered a second class language"

Ch1, page 8. Most likely the tech. editor didn't see the option "Run as JavaScript Web project" because he didn't select the project in Aptana before creating New From Template file. It works fine on Mac for us. But I made clarification in the text anyway.
