== Sencha Touch

Sencha Touch framework is a little brother of Ext JS. They both have the same parent: http://www.sencha.com/[Sencha Inc], but Sencha Touch is created for HTML5 mobile application development, while Ext JS is for desktop Web applications. For enterprise developers, there is another important difference: Ext JS offers free licenses only for open source projects, but http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/license/[Sencha Touch licenses] are free for all.   

This chapter is structured similarly to the previous one on jQuery Mobile. We'll try minimizing repeating the information you can find in http://www.sencha.com/learn/touch[Sencha Touch Learning Center] and extensive product documentation. The chapter will start with a brief overview of the main features of Sencha Touch followed by the code review of yet another version of the Save Sick Child application. 

In this chapter we are going to use Sencha Touch 2.2.1, which is the latest version at the time of this writing. It supports iOS, Android, Blackberry, and when this book is printed, Sencha Touch should support Window Phone 8 too. 

NOTE: If you haven't read Chapter 6 on Ext JS, please do it now. Both of these frameworks are built on the same foundation and understanding of some of the basic concepts like `xType` or classes like `Container` or `Viewport` is a must. 

=== Sencha Touch Overview

Let's start with downloading Sencha Touch from http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/[http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download]. You can download the framework licensed as GPL, but in this case your users may see a little watermark as shown on the <<FIG13-1>> figure below.

For the free commercial license just specify your email address, and you'll receive the link to download in the email. The Sencha Touch framework comes as a zip file, which you should unzip in the directory of your choice - later on the framework will be copied either into your project directory or in the document root of your Web server.  We placed our version of Sencha Touch in the directory _/Library/touch-2.2.1_.


==== Generating Hello World

If you haven't downloaded and installed the Sencha CMD tool, do it now as described in Chapter 6. We'll use Sencha CMD again, but this time to generate a mobile Hello World.  After opening a Terminal or Command Window enter the following command specifying the absolute path to your ExtJS SDK directory (we keep it in the /Library directory) and to the output folder, where the generated project should reside.

_sencha -sdk /Library/touch-2.2.1 generate app HelloWorld /Users/yfain11/hellotouch_

After the code generation was complete, you'll see the folder _hello_ of the structure shown on the figure <<FIG13-2>>.

To test your newly generated application you'll need to make sure that the directory _hellotouch_ is deployed under a Web server (simple opening of index.html in the Web browser won't work). you can either install any Web server or just follow the instructions from section about XAMPP and Apache Web Server in Chapter 6.

TIP: MAC OS users can install a small application http://anvilformac.com/[Anvil] that can easily serve static content of any directory as a Web server with a URL that ends with .dev.

Figure <<FIG13-3>> shows how the generated Hello World application will look in the Chrome browser. It'll consist of two pages controlled by the buttons in the footer toolbar.

==== Implementing Navigation

=== Save Sick Child with Sencha Touch

The Sencha Touch version of the Save Sick Child application will be based on the prototype from Chapter 12, section "Prototyping Mobile Version" with minor changes. This time the home page of the application will be a slightly different version of the About page shown on <<FIG13-11>>. 

In Chapter 6 we started using http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm IDE] from JetBrain, and this is going to be our IDE of choice.

IMPORTANT: The materials presented in this chapter were tested only with the current version of Sencha Touch framework, which at the time of this writing was 2.2.1.

TIP: If you'll add the Save Sick Child application as an icon to the home screen on iOS devices, the browser's address bar will not be displayed.
